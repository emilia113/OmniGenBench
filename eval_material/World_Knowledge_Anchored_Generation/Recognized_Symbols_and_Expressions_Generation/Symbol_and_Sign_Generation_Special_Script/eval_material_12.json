["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**1. Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified symbol, numeral, or word in the correct script or writing system.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image showing the Tibetan script version of the mantra 'Om Mani Padme Hum'.\n\nCombining these, the core task is to ensure \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" is visually present, and it must be in Tibetan script, and that depiction must be accurate.\n\n**2. Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\nThe prompt specifies one primary textual element that needs to be rendered in a specific script.\n\n*   The mantra \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" itself.\n*   The script it must be written in: Tibetan script.\n\nThe visual element is the combination of this text and this script. While the mantra consists of multiple syllables (Om, Ma, Ni, Pad, Me, Hum), which will each have their own Tibetan glyphs, the prompt asks for *the mantra* as a whole. The Key Requirement ensures the accuracy of this entire textual element, which implicitly covers the correctness of each constituent syllable in Tibetan.\n\nTherefore, the single most direct and encompassing visual element required is the mantra written in Tibetan.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   The mantra \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" written in Tibetan script."]
