["Okay, here's the breakdown based on the procedure:\n\n1.  **Key Requirement:** The image must prominently feature the specified brand logo on the described item.\n2.  **Specific Prompt:** \"Generate an image of a cap with the Starbucks logo printed on the front\"\n\nCombining these, the core need is for an image showing a cap with a Starbucks logo clearly visible on its front.\n\nThe distinct visual elements required are:\n\n*   **A cap** (This is the \"described item\" from the Key Requirement and prompt)\n*   **Starbucks logo printed on the front of the cap** (This ensures the \"specified brand logo\" is \"on the described item\" as per the Key Requirement, and incorporates the specific placement \"printed on the front\" from the prompt. The \"prominently feature\" aspect is addressed by this explicit placement.)"]
