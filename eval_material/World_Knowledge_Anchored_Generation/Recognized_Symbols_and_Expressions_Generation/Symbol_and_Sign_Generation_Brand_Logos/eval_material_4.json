["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**1. Understanding the Inputs:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** \"The image must prominently feature the specified brand logo on the described item.\"\n*   **Specific Prompt:** \"Generate an image of a pair of sunglasses with the Ray-Ban logo\"\n\n**2. Combining Key Requirement and Prompt Details:**\n\n*   From the prompt, the \"described item\" is \"a pair of sunglasses\".\n*   From the prompt, the \"specified brand logo\" is \"the Ray-Ban logo\".\n*   Substituting these into the Key Requirement: \"The image must prominently feature the Ray-Ban logo on the pair of sunglasses.\"\n\n**3. Identifying Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\nThe core instruction from the combined understanding is that the Ray-Ban logo must be on the pair of sunglasses and featured prominently. \"Prominently featured\" is a qualitative aspect of how the element should be depicted. The concrete visual element that *must* be present is the sunglasses with the logo on them.\n\nFollowing the example format (\"pedestrian icon in the blank area\"), which describes an object and its context/feature in a single noun phrase, the most direct element is:\n\n*   Ray-Ban logo on a pair of sunglasses\n\nThis single phrase implies:\n    *   The existence of \"a pair of sunglasses\".\n    *   The existence of the \"Ray-Ban logo\".\n    *   The specific relationship: the logo is *on* the sunglasses, satisfying both the prompt's \"with the Ray-Ban logo\" and the Key Requirement's \"logo on the described item\".\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Ray-Ban logo on a pair of sunglasses"]
