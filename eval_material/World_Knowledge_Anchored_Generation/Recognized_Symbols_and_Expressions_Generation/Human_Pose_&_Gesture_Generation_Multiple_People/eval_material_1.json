  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must realistically depict two or more people engaged in a dynamic and coordinated physical activity, capturing motion and balance.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a realistic image of one dancer lifting the other mid-air in a ballet-style leap, both showing graceful posture and fluid motion. The background can be a stage or rehearsal studio.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    *   \"Two or more people\" (KR) + \"one dancer lifting the other\" (Prompt) => Exactly two dancers.\n    *   \"Dynamic and coordinated physical activity\" (KR) + \"lifting the other mid-air in a ballet-style leap\" (Prompt) => A ballet lift with one dancer airborne.\n    *   \"Capturing motion and balance\" (KR) + \"graceful posture and fluid motion\" (Prompt) => Visual cues of movement, elegance, and stability/controlled instability.\n    *   \"Realistically depict\" (KR & Prompt) => Style constraint, not a distinct element.\n    *   \"Background can be a stage or rehearsal studio\" (Prompt) => The setting is one of these two.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   From \"one dancer lifting\":\n        *   A primary dancer (the lifter)\n    *   From \"the other [dancer]\":\n        *   A second dancer (being lifted)\n    *   From \"lifting the other mid-air\":\n        *   The second dancer in a mid-air position\n        *   Physical connection/support between the two dancers for the lift\n    *   From \"ballet-style leap\":\n        *   Poses characteristic of a ballet lift/leap\n    *   From \"graceful posture\":\n        *   Elegant body lines and carriage for both dancers\n    *   From \"fluid motion\":\n        *   Visual cues suggesting movement (e.g., lines of body, fabric, slight blur if appropriate for realism)\n    *   From \"background can be a stage or rehearsal studio\":\n        *   A background environment identifiable as a stage OR a rehearsal studio.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A primary dancer performing a lift\n*   A second dancer being lifted\n*   Lifted dancer in a mid-air position\n*   Ballet-style leap form\n*   Graceful posture for both dancers\n*   Visual indication of fluid motion\n*   Stage or rehearsal studio background"
