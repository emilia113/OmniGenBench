["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified American Sign Language (ASL) sign with clear and precise hand positioning.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of a person performing the sign for 'open window' in American Sign Language.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:** We need a person, and that person must be making the ASL sign for \"open window\" with clear, accurate hand positioning.\n\n2.  **Identify Visual Elements for \"Open Window\" in ASL:**\n    The sign \"OPEN WINDOW\" is a compound sign:\n    *   **WINDOW:** Typically, two flat hands (B-handshapes). The non-dominant hand is held horizontally, palm towards the signer. The dominant hand, also a B-handshape, palm towards the signer, is held above the non-dominant hand and taps it or moves slightly up and down.\n    *   **OPEN (for a window):** After establishing \"WINDOW\" (or sometimes integrated), the hands (still often B-handshapes or similar flat hands) represent the window sashes. They start together (e.g., dominant hand on top of non-dominant, palms facing outward) and the dominant hand moves upward, as if opening a sash window.\n\n    For a single, clear image depicting \"OPEN WINDOW,\" the most recognizable moment would likely be the *action* or *completed state* of opening the window. This usually involves:\n    *   Both hands in a B-handshape (flat hand, fingers together and extended, thumb alongside or slightly tucked).\n    *   Palms facing outwards (away from the signer).\n    *   The non-dominant hand is lower.\n    *   The dominant hand is higher, as if it has just moved upwards from the non-dominant hand.\n    *   The hands are in front of the signer's body, in the typical signing space.\n\n3.  **List Distinct Visual Elements as Short Noun Phrases:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A person.\n*   Person's non-dominant hand in a B-handshape (flat hand, fingers together, thumb alongside palm).\n*   Person's dominant hand in a B-handshape (flat hand, fingers together, thumb alongside palm).\n*   Palms of both hands facing outwards (away from the signer).\n*   Non-dominant hand positioned lower.\n*   Dominant hand positioned vertically above the non-dominant hand.\n*   Both hands clearly visible in front of the person's torso."]
