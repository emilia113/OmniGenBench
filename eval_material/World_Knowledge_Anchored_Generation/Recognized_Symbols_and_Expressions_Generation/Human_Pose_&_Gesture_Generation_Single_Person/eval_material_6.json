  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements:\n\n*   A person (dancer).\n*   The floor.\n*   Dancer's body in a low position, close to or on the floor.\n*   Indication of a spiral or turning motion of the dancer's body.\n*   At least one of the dancer's limbs (arm or leg) in contact with the floor, supporting or guiding the turn.\n*   A visible twist in the dancer's torso.\n*   A background environment: either a dance studio or a minimalist open space."
