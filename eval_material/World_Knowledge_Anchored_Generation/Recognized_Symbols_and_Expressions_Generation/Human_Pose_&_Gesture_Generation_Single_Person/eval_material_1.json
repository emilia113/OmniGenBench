  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must realistically depict a person accurately performing a specific physical pose or movement.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a realistic image of a person performing the Biellmann spin in figure skating, with an elegant posture, on an ice rink.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine & Identify:**\n    *   \"Person\": This is a core element.\n    *   \"Biellmann spin\": This is the specific pose/movement. Its accurate depiction requires several sub-elements:\n        *   The skater is on one leg (supporting leg).\n        *   The other leg (free leg) is pulled up from behind.\n        *   The free leg is extended straight upwards.\n        *   The skater's back is arched.\n        *   The skater is holding the skate blade of the free leg with one or both hands over and behind their head.\n    *   \"Figure skating\": This implies specific equipment and attire.\n        *   Figure skates on the person's feet.\n        *   Appropriate figure skating attire.\n    *   \"Elegant posture\": This is a qualitative aspect of the pose, ensuring the lines are graceful and the pose is held with control, not awkwardly. It influences *how* the elements are depicted.\n    *   \"On an ice rink\": This defines the setting.\n        *   An ice surface.\n    *   \"Realistically depict\" and \"accurately performing\": These reinforce that all the above must be visually correct and physically plausible.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required concrete visual elements:\n\n*   A person (figure skater).\n*   Figure skates (on the person's feet).\n*   Figure skating attire (worn by the person).\n*   An ice rink surface.\n*   Skater's body in an arched-back position.\n*   One leg of the skater (supporting leg) on the ice.\n*   The other leg of the skater (free leg) extended upwards behind their body.\n*   Skater's hand(s) grasping the skate blade of the extended free leg.\n*   The extended free leg's foot/skate positioned above and behind the skater's head."
