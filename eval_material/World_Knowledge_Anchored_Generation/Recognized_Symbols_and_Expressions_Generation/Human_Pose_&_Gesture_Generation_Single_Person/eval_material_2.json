  "Okay, here's the breakdown:\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must realistically depict a person accurately performing a specific physical pose or movement.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a realistic image of a person performing the Warrior III yoga pose. The background should be clean or a minimal yoga studio.\n\n**Procedure & Identification:**\n\n1.  **Person:** Both Key Requirement (\"person\") and prompt (\"person\") demand this.\n2.  **Warrior III Yoga Pose (Accurate Depiction):** This is central. To be \"accurately performing\" Warrior III (Virabhadrasana III), specific body alignments are crucial:\n    *   **Torso:** Must be parallel to the floor.\n    *   **Raised Leg:** One leg must be extended straight back, also parallel to the floor, in line with the torso.\n    *   **Standing Leg:** The other leg must be straight (or with a micro-bend for realism), supporting the body, perpendicular to the floor.\n    *   **Arms:** Typically extended forward, parallel to each other and the floor, in line with the torso and raised leg (forming a \"T\" shape with the body relative to the standing leg). Other arm variations exist (e.g., alongside the body, prayer hands), but \"extended forward\" is the most common and visually clear for a general depiction. Given no specific arm variation is requested, the most standard one should be assumed for \"accurate performance.\"\n3.  **Background:** The prompt specifies \"clean or a minimal yoga studio.\" This is a single requirement for the type of background.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A person\n*   Person's torso parallel to the floor\n*   One leg of the person extended straight backward, parallel to the floor\n*   Person's standing leg straight and supporting the body\n*   Person's arms extended straight forward, parallel to the floor\n*   A clean or minimal yoga studio background"
