["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must depict a specific cultural festival or celebration associated with the specified location or country.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image showing a Day of the Dead scene in South America.\n\n**Procedure & Analysis:**\n1.  **Combine:** We need a \"Day of the Dead scene\" (cultural festival) set in \"South America\" (location). While Day of the Dead (D\u00eda de Muertos) is most famously and elaborately celebrated in Mexico (North America), similar traditions of honoring the dead exist in various South American countries, often syncretized with indigenous beliefs and Catholic All Saints' Day/All Souls' Day. The prompt explicitly asks for \"Day of the Dead scene,\" so we will focus on iconic elements associated with this broader concept, ensuring they can plausibly fit a South American context.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Skulls (Calaveras):** Often decorated, a central motif.\n    *   **Skeletons (Calacas):** Often depicted in festive attire or activities.\n    *   **Marigolds (Cempas\u00fachil or similar bright orange/yellow flowers):** Strongly associated with guiding spirits.\n    *   **Altars (Ofrendas):** Created to honor the deceased, laden with offerings.\n    *   **Food Offerings:** Placed on altars, specific types vary but the concept is key.\n    *   **Drink Offerings:** Also placed on altars.\n    *   **Candles:** Used to light the way for spirits and for remembrance.\n    *   **Papel Picado (optional but common):** Perforated paper banners, though more strongly Mexican, are widely recognized.\n    *   **People (optional but common):** May be present, sometimes with faces painted as skulls (Catrina/Catrin style).\n    *   **South American Setting Cues (implicit):** While not a single \"element,\" the overall scene should evoke South America (e.g., architecture, landscape hints if visible, clothing if people are prominent). However, the prompt doesn't specify *which* South American country, so we'll focus on the festival elements that are more universally recognizable for \"Day of the Dead.\"\n\n3.  **Filter for \"Must Include\" and \"Concrete Visual\" (avoiding uncertainty):**\n    The core, undeniable visual elements of a \"Day of the Dead\" celebration are:\n    *   Decorated skulls\n    *   Skeletal figures\n    *   Brightly colored flowers (like marigolds)\n    *   Altars\n    *   Offerings on altars (food, drink)\n    *   Candles\n\n    These elements are central to the festival and are visually concrete. The \"South America\" aspect will be the backdrop or context for these elements.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Decorated skulls\n*   Skeletal figures\n*   Bright orange or yellow flowers (indicative of marigolds)\n*   Altars (ofrendas)\n*   Food offerings on altars\n*   Drink offerings on altars\n*   Lit candles"]
