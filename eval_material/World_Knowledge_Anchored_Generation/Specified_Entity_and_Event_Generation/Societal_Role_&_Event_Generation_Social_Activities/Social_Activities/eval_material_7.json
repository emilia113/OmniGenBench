["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specific event or theme described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image depicting the FIFA World Cup.\n*   **Partial Image:** None supplied.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement with Prompt Details:**\n    The image must accurately depict the FIFA World Cup. This means it needs visual cues that are strongly and uniquely associated with this specific international football tournament, distinguishing it from a generic football match or another tournament.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   **The Trophy:** The FIFA World Cup trophy itself is iconic and instantly recognizable. Its presence strongly signals the event.\n    *   **Soccer Players:** Essential for a football match.\n    *   **National Team Kits:** The World Cup features national teams, so players should be in kits representing different countries, not club teams.\n    *   **Soccer Ball:** A standard element of any football match.\n    *   **Stadium:** The World Cup is played in large, often modern, stadiums.\n    *   **Crowd/Spectators:** A significant part of the atmosphere, often displaying national colors or flags.\n    *   **Flags:** National flags (of participating countries) are a key visual, whether waved by fans, displayed on banners, or subtly integrated.\n    *   **Pitch/Field:** A green grass football pitch with markings and goalposts.\n\n3.  **Filter for \"Must Include\" and write as short noun phrases:**\n\n    *   The FIFA World Cup trophy (or \"World Cup trophy\")\n    *   Soccer players in national team kits\n    *   A soccer ball\n    *   A large stadium setting\n    *   Spectators (often with national colors/flags)\n    *   A green soccer pitch with goalposts\n    *   Visible national flags\n\n    Let's refine to ensure no uncertainty and conciseness. The presence of \"national team kits\" and \"visible national flags\" covers the international aspect well. \"Spectators\" are implied by a \"large stadium setting\" for a major event, but explicitly stating them reinforces the atmosphere.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   The FIFA World Cup trophy\n*   Soccer players in distinct national team kits\n*   A soccer ball\n*   A green soccer pitch with goalposts\n*   A large stadium\n*   Spectators in the stadium\n*   Visible national flags (e.g., in the crowd, on banners)"]
