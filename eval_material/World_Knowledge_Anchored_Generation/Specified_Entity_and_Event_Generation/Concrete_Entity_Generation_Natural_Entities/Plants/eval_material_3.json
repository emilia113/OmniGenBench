["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specific plant or tree species mentioned in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of a Venus flytrap\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:** The image must accurately depict a Venus flytrap.\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for a Venus flytrap:**\n    To accurately depict a Venus flytrap, certain key morphological features must be visible. These are:\n    *   The characteristic \"traps\" themselves, which are modified leaves. Each trap consists of two hinged lobes.\n    *   The \"teeth\" or stiff cilia that line the margins of these lobes.\n    *   The photosynthetic part of the leaf, typically a flattened, heart-shaped or ovate petiole, from which the trap structure arises.\n    *   (Optional but common: trigger hairs inside open traps, reddish interior of traps). However, the prompt asks for what *must* be included. If all traps are closed, trigger hairs wouldn't be visible, but it would still be a Venus flytrap. The reddish interior is common but not universal or strictly defining for all visual representations.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Hinged trap lobes (forming the \"mouth\")\n*   Stiff cilia (teeth-like projections) along trap lobe margins\n*   Flattened, photosynthetic leaf petioles (from which traps emerge)"]
