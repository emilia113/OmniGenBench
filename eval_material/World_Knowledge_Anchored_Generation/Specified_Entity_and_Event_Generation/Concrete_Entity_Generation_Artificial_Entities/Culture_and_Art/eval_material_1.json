["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**1. Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict an artifact that is culturally and historically representative of the specified civilization or group.\n*   **Prompt:** Generate an image of a hand-carved wooden sculpture.\n*   **Combined Understanding:** The image must show a hand-carved wooden sculpture. This sculpture itself must serve as the \"artifact.\" Since no specific civilization or group is mentioned in the prompt, the \"culturally and historically representative\" aspect means the sculpture should appear authentic and plausible as an artifact from *some* culture, rather than, for example, a clearly modern mass-produced item or something anachronistic, unless such a context was implied for an unspecified group. The visual elements will primarily derive from \"hand-carved wooden sculpture.\"\n\n**2. Identify distinct visual elements:**\nBased on the combined understanding, the essential visual components are:\n    *   The object itself must be a sculpture.\n    *   The material of the sculpture must be visibly wood.\n    *   The method of creation \u2013 hand-carving \u2013 must be apparent.\n\nThe Key Requirement (being an \"artifact\") is fulfilled if these elements are rendered in a way that is consistent with a man-made object of potential cultural or historical significance. No *additional* objects or specific cultural symbols can be listed as required because no culture was specified.\n\n**3. Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\nHere is the bullet list of required elements:\n\n*   A sculpture\n*   Wooden material (e.g., visible grain, texture)\n*   Hand-carved details (e.g., tool marks, non-uniform surfaces indicative of manual work)"]
