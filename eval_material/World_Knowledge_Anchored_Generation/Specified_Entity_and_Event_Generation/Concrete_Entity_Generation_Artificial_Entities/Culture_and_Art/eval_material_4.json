["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict an artifact that is culturally and historically representative of the specified civilization or group.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of a Native American Plains beadwork saddle blanket.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine:** We need a \"Native American Plains beadwork saddle blanket\" that is \"culturally and historically representative\" of Native American Plains groups.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n    *   **Saddle blanket:** The fundamental object. It has a general shape meant to go under a saddle on a horse.\n    *   **Beadwork:** This is the primary decorative technique. It implies small beads stitched onto a surface.\n    *   **Native American Plains style:** This is crucial for cultural and historical representation. This means the beadwork patterns, colors, and potentially the base material of the blanket should be characteristic of Plains tribes.\n        *   **Patterns:** Typically geometric for older Plains beadwork (triangles, diamonds, lines, stepped motifs, box-and-border). Sometimes floral, especially in later periods or specific regional styles, but geometric is a strong signifier.\n        *   **Colors:** Traditional color palettes (e.g., white, various blues, reds, yellows, greens, black).\n        *   **Materials for beadwork:** Glass seed beads.\n        *   **Base material of blanket:** Often hide (buckskin) or wool cloth (e.g., stroud cloth, often red or blue).\n\n3.  **Write as short noun phrases (focusing on \"must include\" and avoiding uncertainty):**\n\n    *   The object itself: \"Saddle blanket form\"\n    *   The primary decoration: \"Beadwork application\"\n    *   The components of the beadwork: \"Visible individual beads\"\n    *   The style of the beadwork for cultural accuracy: \"Plains Native American style beadwork patterns\" (often geometric)\n    *   The colors used in the beadwork for cultural accuracy: \"Traditional Plains beadwork color palette\"\n    *   The base of the blanket: \"Textile or hide backing material\" (for the beads to be sewn onto)\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Saddle blanket form\n*   Visible individual beads\n*   Plains Native American style beadwork patterns\n*   Traditional Plains beadwork color palette\n*   Textile or hide backing material for the blanket"]
