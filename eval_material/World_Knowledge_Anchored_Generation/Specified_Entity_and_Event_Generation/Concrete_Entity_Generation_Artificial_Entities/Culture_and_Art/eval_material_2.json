["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict an artifact that is culturally and historically representative of the specified civilization or group.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of an Aztec obsidian sacrificial knife\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine & Identify Core Components:**\n    *   The artifact is a \"knife.\"\n    *   The material of the blade is \"obsidian.\"\n    *   The purpose is \"sacrificial.\"\n    *   The cultural group is \"Aztec.\"\n    *   The Key Requirement demands cultural and historical accuracy and representation.\n\n2.  **Visual Elements Derivation:**\n    *   **\"Knife\":** Implies a blade and usually a handle.\n    *   **\"Obsidian\":** The blade must look like obsidian \u2013 typically black, glassy, with conchoidal fractures (curved, shell-like breaks from knapping).\n    *   **\"Sacrificial\" & \"Aztec\":** This points to a specific type of knife, often known as a *tecpatl*. These had characteristic shapes (often leaf-shaped or lanceolate) and sometimes ornate handles. The overall design must be recognizably Aztec.\n    *   **\"Culturally and historically representative\":** This reinforces that the blade shape, handle design (if any specific details are chosen by the AI), and overall aesthetic must align with known Aztec examples, not generic \"stone age knife\" imagery.\n\n3.  **List of Required Elements (Noun Phrases):**\n\n    *   An obsidian blade\n    *   Characteristic flaked (knapped) texture of the obsidian blade\n    *   A handle for the knife\n    *   Overall design consistent with historical Aztec *tecpatl* (sacrificial knife) examples\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n*   An obsidian blade\n*   Characteristic flaked (knapped) texture of the obsidian blade\n*   A handle for the knife\n*   Overall design consistent with historical Aztec *tecpatl* (sacrificial knife) examples"]
