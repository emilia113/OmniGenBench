["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specific object mentioned in each prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of a DJ mixing console\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement with Prompt:** The image must accurately depict a \"DJ mixing console.\"\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for a \"DJ mixing console\":**\n    *   What makes something a DJ mixing console?\n        *   It has a main body/chassis.\n        *   It has faders (sliders) for controlling volume levels of different channels.\n        *   It typically has a crossfader to transition between two main audio sources.\n        *   It has multiple knobs (rotary controls) for equalization (EQ), gain, effects, etc.\n        *   It often has buttons for cueing, effects activation, or other functions.\n        *   It usually has some form of level metering (like LED lights) to show audio signal strength.\n        *   While some DJ *controllers* have integrated platters, a \"DJ mixing console\" *itself* is primarily the mixing section. The prompt specifies \"mixing console,\" not \"DJ controller\" or \"DJ decks.\" So, platters are not a *must* for the console itself, though they are often associated with the overall DJ setup. To stick to the \"must include\" and \"no uncertain elements\" for the *console*, I will focus on the mixer unit.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Main console body\n*   Channel faders\n*   Crossfader\n*   Rotary control knobs\n*   Buttons\n*   LED level meters"]
