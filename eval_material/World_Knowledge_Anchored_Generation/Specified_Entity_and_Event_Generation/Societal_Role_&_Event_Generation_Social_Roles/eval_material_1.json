  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input Analysis:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must prominently feature the specified professional engaged in their respective task or role.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of a police officer inspecting cars at a checkpoint.\n\n**Combining and Identifying Elements:**\n\n1.  **The Professional:** \"police officer\"\n    *   This implies a person.\n    *   To be identifiable as a police officer, they would typically wear a \"police uniform.\"\n    *   A \"badge\" or other insignia might be part of this but \"police uniform\" is more encompassing and visually primary.\n\n2.  **Their Task/Role:** \"inspecting cars\"\n    *   This requires at least one \"car\" (the object being inspected).\n    *   The action of \"inspecting\" means the officer should be visually interacting with the car in a way that suggests examination (e.g., looking inside, talking to an occupant through the window, examining the exterior). While the *action* isn't a static element, the *visual depiction* of this interaction is key.\n\n3.  **The Setting/Context:** \"at a checkpoint\"\n    *   A checkpoint has specific visual cues. These could include:\n        *   \"Road barriers\" or \"traffic cones.\"\n        *   \"Checkpoint signage\" (e.g., \"STOP,\" \"Police Checkpoint\").\n        *   Potentially a \"police vehicle\" (though not strictly mandatory if other checkpoint elements are clear).\n\n4.  **Prominently Feature & Engaged:** This reinforces that the \"police officer\" and their \"inspection of the car(s)\" must be central and clear in the image.\n\n**List of Required Concrete Visual Elements:**\n\n*   A police officer\n*   A police uniform (worn by the officer)\n*   At least one car\n*   Checkpoint indicators (such as road barriers, traffic cones, or checkpoint signage)"
