["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified natural landmark or location.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of Mount Fuji.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image must accurately depict Mount Fuji.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n    To accurately depict Mount Fuji, the image must show the mountain itself, with its characteristic features.\n    *   The primary element is Mount Fuji. This implies its generally symmetrical, conical volcanic shape.\n    *   A very common and iconic feature that contributes significantly to its recognizability (and thus \"accurate depiction\" for many viewers) is its snow-capped peak. While Mount Fuji isn't snow-capped year-round, an image without it might be considered less \"iconically Fuji\" by many, though still technically Fuji. However, the prompt is simple \"Mount Fuji,\" not \"Mount Fuji in winter\" or \"snow-capped Mount Fuji.\" The Key Requirement is \"accurately depict.\" A summer Fuji without snow is still an accurate depiction.\n    *   The core, undeniable element is the mountain itself.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n    The most direct and essential element is the landmark itself.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Mount Fuji (with its characteristic conical shape)"]
