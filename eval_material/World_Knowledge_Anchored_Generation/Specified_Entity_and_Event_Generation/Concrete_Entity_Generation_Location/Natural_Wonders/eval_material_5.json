["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified natural landmark or location.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of Yellowstone Hot Springs\n\n**Procedure & Identification:**\n\n1.  **Combine:** The image must accurately depict Yellowstone Hot Springs.\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for \"Yellowstone Hot Springs\":**\n    *   **Water:** Hot springs are, by definition, bodies of water. So, \"pools of water\" or \"thermal water.\"\n    *   **Heat Indication:** \"Hot\" implies visible signs of heat, most commonly steam or vapor. So, \"steam/vapor.\"\n    *   **Colors:** Yellowstone hot springs are famous for their vibrant, often unnatural-looking colors due to thermophilic bacteria and dissolved minerals. These colors appear in the water and on the surrounding mineral deposits. So, \"vibrant colors,\" \"multi-colored water,\" \"colorful mineral deposits.\"\n    *   **Mineral Formations:** The minerals in the hot water often create distinctive formations, terraces, or crusts around the edges of the springs. So, \"mineral deposits/formations\" or \"sinter/travertine terraces\" (though \"mineral deposits\" is more general and less technical).\n    *   **Natural Setting:** While not the primary focus, the springs are in a natural environment, so some indication of \"natural ground\" or \"earth/rock\" around them is expected, distinct from man-made structures (unless specifically requested, which they aren't here).\n\n**Filtering for \"Must Include\" and \"Concrete Visual Element\" (and not uncertain):**\n*   \"Pools of thermal water\": Must include.\n*   \"Steam or vapor rising from the water\": Must include (to show \"hot\").\n*   \"Vibrant, multi-colored water (e.g., blues, greens, yellows, oranges)\": Must include (iconic to Yellowstone).\n*   \"Colorful mineral deposits/terraces around the water edges\": Must include (iconic to Yellowstone).\n\nThese elements are directly observable and characteristic of Yellowstone Hot Springs.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Pools of thermal water\n*   Steam or vapor rising from the water\n*   Vibrant, multi-colored water (e.g., blues, greens, yellows, oranges)\n*   Colorful mineral deposits/terraces around the water edges"]
