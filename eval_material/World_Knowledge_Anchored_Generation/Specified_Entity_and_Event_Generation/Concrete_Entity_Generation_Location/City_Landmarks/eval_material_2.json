["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must prominently feature the specified iconic landmark or location associated with each city.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of Tiananmen Square, Beijing\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The prompt specifies \"Tiananmen Square, Beijing\". The Key Requirement mandates that Tiananmen Square, as the iconic location/landmark, must be prominently featured.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for \"Tiananmen Square\" to be prominently featured:**\n    To be recognizably and prominently Tiananmen Square, certain core elements are essential.\n    *   The **Tiananmen Gate** (Gate of Heavenly Peace) is the most iconic structure and the namesake.\n    *   The **Mao Zedong portrait** is a permanent and highly recognizable feature on the Tiananmen Gate.\n    *   The **vast, open plaza** itself is definitional to \"Tiananmen Square\".\n\n    Other elements like the Monument to the People's Heroes, the Great Hall of the People, or the National Museum of China are part of the larger Tiananmen Square complex, but an image could still prominently feature \"Tiananmen Square\" by focusing on the Gate and the expanse of the square in front of it, without necessarily including these other structures in detail. The key is the prominent feature of the *specified* landmark/location.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Tiananmen Gate structure\n*   Mao Zedong portrait on the gate\n*   Large open plaza area"]
