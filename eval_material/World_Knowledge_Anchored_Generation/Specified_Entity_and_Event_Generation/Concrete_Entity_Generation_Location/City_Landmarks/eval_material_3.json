Tower Bridge is inherently situated on the River Thames in London.\n\nTo satisfy both, the image must clearly show Tower Bridge. What are the essential, concrete visual components of Tower Bridge itself, and its immediate, inseparable context?\n\n*   **Tower Bridge itself:** This is the primary subject.\n*   **The two main towers:** These are the most recognizable structural elements of Tower Bridge.\n*   **The high-level walkways:** These connect the two towers at the top.\n*   **The bascule (lifting) roadway sections:** The lower part of the bridge that opens for ships.\n*   **The River Thames:** Tower Bridge spans this river; it's an integral part of its setting and identity.\n\nThese elements are concrete, visually distinct, and essential for an image to be unmistakably \"Tower Bridge, London\" and for Tower Bridge to be \"prominently featured.\"\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Tower Bridge structure\n*   Two main towers\n*   High-level walkways\n*   Bascule roadway sections\n*   River Thames"]
