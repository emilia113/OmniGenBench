["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified historical or cultural landmark.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of Colosseum, Ancient Rome\n\n**Procedure & Element Identification:**\n\n1.  **Combine:** The image needs to be an *accurate depiction* of the *Colosseum* specifically within the context of *Ancient Rome*. This means it shouldn't look like the Colosseum today with modern surroundings, nor should it be a generic amphitheater.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for \"Colosseum, Ancient Rome\":**\n    *   What makes the Colosseum the Colosseum?\n        *   Its massive, elliptical (oval) shape.\n        *   The multi-tiered arched exterior.\n        *   The characteristic partially ruined outer wall (even in \"Ancient Rome\" depictions, it wasn't always pristine or fully complete, and its iconic look often includes this).\n        *   The central arena space.\n        *   Construction material: stone (travertine, tufa, concrete).\n    *   What implies \"Ancient Rome\" context for the Colosseum itself?\n        *   Absence of modern elements (no modern tourists, cars, surrounding modern buildings, electric lights).\n        *   The architectural style should be consistent with Roman engineering of the period.\n\n3.  **Filter for \"must include\" and \"concrete visual element,\" avoiding uncertainty:**\n    *   \"The Colosseum structure itself\": This is the primary subject.\n    *   \"Elliptical/oval shape\": Essential for identification.\n    *   \"Multiple levels/tiers\": A defining feature.\n    *   \"Arches on the exterior\": The most prominent repeating element.\n    *   \"Partially ruined outer wall\": This is highly characteristic and helps distinguish it. While it was fully intact at one point, \"accurate depiction\" often leans into its most recognizable state, even within a broader \"Ancient Rome\" context. If we wanted it pristine, the prompt might say \"Colosseum newly built.\"\n    *   \"Central arena area\": The core functional part.\n    *   \"Stone construction\": The material.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   The Colosseum structure\n*   Characteristic elliptical/oval shape of the amphitheater\n*   Multiple external tiers or levels\n*   Numerous arches on the exterior facade\n*   Partially ruined/incomplete sections of the outer wall\n*   Visible central arena area\n*   Stone-like texture and appearance consistent with ancient Roman construction"]
