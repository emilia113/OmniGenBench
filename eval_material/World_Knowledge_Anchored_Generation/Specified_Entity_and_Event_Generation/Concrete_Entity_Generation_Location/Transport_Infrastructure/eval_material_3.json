["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified landmark or location mentioned in each prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of Tokyo Shinkansen Central Station\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:** The image must accurately depict \"Tokyo Shinkansen Central Station.\" This means the visual elements should be characteristic of a major Shinkansen (bullet train) station in Tokyo.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Shinkansen:** The most obvious element. These are high-speed bullet trains with a distinctive sleek, aerodynamic design.\n    *   **Train Platform:** Shinkansen stop at dedicated platforms. These are typically long, covered, and may have safety barriers or markings.\n    *   **Railway Tracks:** Multiple sets of tracks are expected for a \"Central Station.\"\n    *   **Station Signage:** Essential for any station. For \"Tokyo Shinkansen Central Station,\" this would likely include:\n        *   Platform numbers.\n        *   Destination information.\n        *   Signage in Japanese (as it's Tokyo). English might also be present.\n    *   **Overhead Catenary System:** Shinkansen are electric trains, so the overhead wires and supporting structures are a must.\n    *   **Station Architecture:** \"Central Station\" implies a large, significant structure. This could be a visible part of the station building, a large roof covering the platforms, supporting pillars, etc. It should look like a major transportation hub.\n    *   **\"Tokyo\" Context:** While abstract, this is reinforced by Japanese signage and potentially the specific design of newer Shinkansen models often seen in Tokyo.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Shinkansen bullet train(s)\n*   Train platform(s)\n*   Railway tracks\n*   Station signage (including Japanese characters)\n*   Overhead catenary (power lines for trains)\n*   Architectural elements of a large, modern train station"]
