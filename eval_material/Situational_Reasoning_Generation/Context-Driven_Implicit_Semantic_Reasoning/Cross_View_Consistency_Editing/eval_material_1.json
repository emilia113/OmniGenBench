  "To generate the list of concrete visual elements, we will combine the Key Requirement with the details from the specific prompt and the provided images.\n\n**Key Requirement:** The image must show the scene from the same viewpoint as the third image, reflecting the state after the change in a manner consistent with the transformation shown between the first and second images.\n\n**Analysis of Images and Transformation:**\n1.  **Image 1 (Viewpoint A, Before Change):** Shows a cake with two lit candles (one pink, one yellow/red striped). A person in overalls is partially visible.\n2.  **Image 2 (Viewpoint A, After Change):** Same viewpoint as Image 1. The pink candle is now blown out, showing a glowing ember/faint wisp of smoke at the wick. The yellow/red striped candle remains lit.\n3.  **Image 3 (Viewpoint B, Before Change):** Shows a child's right facial profile close to two lit candles (pink on the left, yellow/red striped on the right). Part of the cake and background (cabinet, wall) are visible.\n\n**Transformation:** The change between Image 1 and Image 2 is that the pink candle is extinguished (now has a glowing ember/smoke), while the yellow/red striped candle remains lit.\n\n**Target Image Requirements:**\n*   **Viewpoint:** Must be the same as Image 3. This means we see the child's right profile, the specific arrangement of candles relative to the child and each other, the visible portion of the cake, and the background elements from Image 3.\n*   **State:** Must reflect the state *after* the change (as seen in Image 2). This means the pink candle should be extinguished (with glowing ember/smoke), and the yellow/red striped candle should be lit.\n\n**Concrete Visual Elements for the Final Image:**\n\nBased on the above, the final image must contain the following distinct visual elements, viewed from the perspective of Image 3, with the changes applied:\n\n*   Child's right facial profile\n*   Pink candle with a glowing ember or faint smoke (unlit)\n*   Lit yellow and red striped candle with a visible flame\n*   Top surface of a cake (where candles are placed)\n*   Light-colored wooden cabinet in the background\n*   Light-colored wall surface in the background\n*   Visible portion of the child's light-colored, textured clothing\n*   Visible portion of the child's light brown hair"
