  "Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the specific prompt (and partial image, if any) that I should use with the Key Requirement.\n\nOnce you provide the specific prompt, I will combine it with the Key Requirement:\n\"The image must show the scene from the same viewpoint as the third image, reflecting the state after the change in a manner consistent with the transformation shown between the first and second images.\"\n...and then list the concrete visual elements.\n\n**Anticipating the need for a placeholder output if no prompt is immediately given:**\n\nIf I were to generate a *template* for the output based *only* on the Key Requirement (before receiving a specific prompt), the elements would be described in relation to the (as yet unseen) \"third image\" and the (as yet undefined) \"transformation.\"\n\n**Example Placeholder Output (awaiting specific prompt):**\n\n*   All static background elements visible in the \"third image,\" rendered from the identical viewpoint.\n*   The primary subject(s) from the \"third image,\" but altered according to the \"transformation rule\" (derived from images 1 and 2) and further detailed by the specific prompt.\n*   Any secondary subjects or objects from the \"third image,\" similarly altered if the \"transformation rule\" applies, or retained if it does not, with specifics from the prompt.\n*   Visual characteristics (e.g., lighting, style) consistent with the \"third image,\" unless the \"transformation rule\" or the specific prompt explicitly modifies them.\n\n**Please provide the specific prompt for Part 2.**"
