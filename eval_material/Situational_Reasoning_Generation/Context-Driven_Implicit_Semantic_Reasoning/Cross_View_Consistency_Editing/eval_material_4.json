  "Okay, I'm ready for Part 2. To proceed, I need:\n\n1.  **The specific prompt** for the final image.\n2.  **(If supplied) The partial image** associated with that prompt.\n3.  **(Crucially, for context) The third image** from the sequence mentioned in the Key Requirement (to establish the viewpoint).\n4.  **(Ideally, for context) The first and second images** from the sequence (to understand the nature of the transformation).\n\nThe Key Requirement is: \"The image must show the scene from the same viewpoint as the third image, reflecting the state after the change in a manner consistent with the transformation shown between the first and second images.\"\n\n**Once I have the specific prompt and the necessary reference images, I will proceed as follows:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation (Image 1 to Image 2):** I'll determine what changed (e.g., object added/removed, object property changed like color/texture, object state changed like open/closed).\n2.  **Analyze Image 3:** I'll note all key elements and their arrangement from its specific viewpoint.\n3.  **Interpret the Specific Prompt:** I'll understand what new state or modification the prompt describes for the final image.\n4.  **Apply Transformation Logic:** I will apply the *type* of transformation observed between Image 1 and 2 to Image 3, guided by the specific prompt, to conceptualize the final image.\n5.  **Extract Elements:** Based on this, I will list the concrete visual elements.\n\n**Example of how I would proceed if I had hypothetical inputs:**\n\nLet's assume:\n*   **Transformation (Image 1 to 2):** A blue ball on a table (Image 1) becomes a red ball on the same table (Image 2). The transformation is a color change of the main object.\n*   **Image 3 shows:** A green bicycle leaning against a brick wall, viewed from the side.\n*   **Specific Prompt for final image:** \"The bicycle is now yellow.\"\n\nBased on this hypothetical scenario, the required elements for the final image would be:\n\n*   Yellow bicycle\n*   Brick wall (as seen in image 3)\n*   Ground surface (as seen in image 3)\n*   Side view of the bicycle (consistent with image 3)\n*   Shadows and lighting consistent with image 3 (adjusted for a yellow bicycle)\n*   Any other distinct background/foreground elements from image 3's viewpoint (e.g., \"a small plant pot in the corner,\" \"a specific pattern on the bricks\")\n\n**Please provide the specific prompt and any associated images (especially Image 3 from the sequence) so I can generate the list of required elements.**"
