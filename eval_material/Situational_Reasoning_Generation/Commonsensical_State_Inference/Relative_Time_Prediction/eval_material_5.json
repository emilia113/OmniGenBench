  "Here is a bullet list of required elements:\n\n*   Multiple densely grown plants (evolved from the original seedlings, now significantly larger and bushier, potentially showing some signs of stress such as yellowing lower leaves due to being in small pots for an extended period).\n*   Degraded original peat pots (the same biodegradable pots from the original image, now containing the larger plants, and showing clear signs of four months of weathering and use, such as discoloration, stains, mold, tears, or slight deformation, with roots possibly visible).\n*   Aged black plastic tray (the tray seen holding the pots in the original image, still present and showing signs of four months of use, like water stains, soil residue, or mineral deposits).\n*   Weathered stack of unused peat pots (the stack of spare pots visible on the right side of the original image, now appearing somewhat dusty, discolored, or generally aged from four months of exposure)."
