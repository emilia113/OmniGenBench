  "juding_criteria": "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must include a prominently displayed title in Japanese that aligns with the theme of the poster.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** The poster is styled in traditional Chinese brush-and-ink inspired illustration, blended with modern layout. The title reads “旧正月ギフト特集” ... and a QR code styled as a decorative seal.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt Details:**\n    *   The Key Requirement demands a \"prominently displayed title in Japanese.\"\n    *   The prompt specifies this title is \"旧正月ギフト特集\".\n    *   The prompt also adds \"a QR code styled as a decorative seal.\"\n    *   The overall style is \"traditional Chinese brush-and-ink inspired illustration, blended with modern layout.\" While this is a style, it implies the *presence* of elements rendered this way.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   The Japanese title text itself.\n    *   The QR code.\n    *   The styling of the QR code as a decorative seal.\n    *   The brush-and-ink illustration style (this will manifest as visual characteristics on the elements and potentially background).\n    *   The modern layout (this will manifest in the arrangement and composition).\n\n    However, the instruction \"Do not include any uncertain visual elements to Key Requirement\" and \"Write each element as a short noun phrase, such as 'pedestrian icon in the blank area'\" guides us to focus on *concrete objects/text* rather than stylistic descriptions as list items, unless the style *is* the element (like \"a decorative seal\"). The style will *apply* to the concrete elements.\n\n    Let's refine:\n    *   The title text \"旧正月ギフト特集\" is a concrete element.\n    *   The \"QR code\" is a concrete element.\n    *   The \"decorative seal\" aspect is a concrete visual styling applied *to* the QR code.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Japanese title text \"旧正月ギフト特集\"\n*   QR code styled as a decorative seal"
