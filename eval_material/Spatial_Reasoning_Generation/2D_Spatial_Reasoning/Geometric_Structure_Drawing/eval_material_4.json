  "Okay, here's the breakdown for Part 2.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict geometric shapes and their precise relationships, ensuring that specified points, lines, or vertices align exactly as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image of three concentric circles with radii of 2, 4, and 6 units, all sharing the same center point.\n\n**Procedure:**\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt Details:**\n    *   The Key Requirement emphasizes accurate geometric shapes and precise relationships, especially alignment of points.\n    *   The prompt specifies:\n        *   Three circles.\n        *   Concentric nature (sharing the same center point).\n        *   Specific radii: 2 units, 4 units, 6 units.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   \"Three circles\": This means there must be a first circle, a second circle, and a third circle.\n    *   \"radii of 2... units\": This defines the size of the smallest circle.\n    *   \"radii of... 4... units\": This defines the size of the middle circle.\n    *   \"radii of... 6 units\": This defines the size of the largest circle.\n    *   \"concentric circles... all sharing the same center point\": This is a crucial relationship and implies a single point that is the center for all three. The Key Requirement's focus on \"specified points... align exactly\" makes this center point a key visual element, even if not explicitly drawn as a dot, its *existence and shared nature* is paramount.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A circle with a radius of 2 units.\n*   A circle with a radius of 4 units.\n*   A circle with a radius of 6 units.\n*   A single, shared center point for all three circles."
