  "To list every concrete visual element the final image must contain, based on the Key Requirement and the specific prompt:\n\nKey Requirement: The image must accurately depict a polygon with specified interior angles listed in clockwise order.\nPrompt: Generate an image of a triangle with interior angles of 60°, 60°, and 60°, listed in clockwise order.\n\nCombining these:\nThe image must be a polygon.\nThe polygon must be a triangle (i.e., have 3 sides and 3 vertices).\nThe interior angles of this triangle must be 60°, 60°, and 60°.\nThese angle values are specified in a clockwise order. This means if one were to pick a starting vertex and list the interior angles encountered while moving clockwise to subsequent vertices, the sequence would be 60°, then 60°, then 60°.\n\nThe distinct visual elements are:\n\n*   A polygon shape.\n*   Three sides forming the polygon.\n*   Three vertices of the polygon.\n*   A first interior angle of the polygon measuring 60 degrees.\n*   A second interior angle of the polygon, clockwise from the first, measuring 60 degrees.\n*   A third interior angle of the polygon, clockwise from the second, measuring 60 degrees."
