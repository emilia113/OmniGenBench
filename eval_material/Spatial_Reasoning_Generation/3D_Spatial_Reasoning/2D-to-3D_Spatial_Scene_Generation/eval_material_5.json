  "Okay, let's proceed with Part 2.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately reconstruct the interior scene based on the spatial configuration of the provided 2D floor plan, including room shapes, walls, and furniture placements.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** \"A 3D rendering of a modern apartment living room, as depicted in the provided floor plan. The room features a large L-shaped sofa, a rectangular coffee table, a TV stand with a television, and a floor lamp. Natural light streams in from a large window. The style is minimalist with a neutral color palette.\"\n*   **Partial Image:** (None supplied for this example)\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The core is the floor plan's spatial accuracy. The prompt specifies this is for a \"modern apartment living room\" and lists specific furniture and features that must adhere to the floor plan's layout.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   From the Key Requirement (applied to the living room):\n        *   Living room walls (as defined by the floor plan)\n        *   Living room shape (as defined by the floor plan)\n        *   Furniture placement (as defined by the floor plan for the items below)\n    *   From the specific prompt:\n        *   L-shaped sofa\n        *   Rectangular coffee table\n        *   TV stand\n        *   Television (on the TV stand)\n        *   Floor lamp\n        *   Large window (its location dictated by the floor plan)\n        *   Natural light (effect, streaming from the window)\n\n    The \"3D rendering,\" \"modern,\" \"minimalist,\" and \"neutral color palette\" are style and attribute requirements, not distinct *objects* themselves. They describe *how* the elements should appear.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Living room walls (matching floor plan)\n*   L-shaped sofa (matching floor plan placement)\n*   Rectangular coffee table (matching floor plan placement)\n*   TV stand (matching floor plan placement)\n*   Television (on TV stand)\n*   Floor lamp (matching floor plan placement)\n*   Large window (matching floor plan location)\n*   Visible natural light (streaming from window)"
