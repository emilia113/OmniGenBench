  "Okay, here are the concrete visual elements for the histogram:\n\n*   A horizontal x-axis.\n*   An x-axis label (e.g., \"Score Range\" or \"Exam Scores\").\n*   X-axis tick marks and labels representing the score intervals (e.g., \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\" or alternatively, bin edges like \"50\", \"60\", \"70\", \"80\", \"90\", \"100\").\n*   A vertical y-axis.\n*   A y-axis label (e.g., \"Frequency\" or \"Number of Students\").\n*   Y-axis tick marks and numerical labels representing frequency values (e.g., scaled from 0 up to at least 7).\n*   Five rectangular bars.\n*   The first bar (for \"50-59\") with a height proportional to the frequency of 2.\n*   The second bar (for \"60-69\") with a height proportional to the frequency of 5.\n*   The third bar (for \"70-79\") with a height proportional to the frequency of 7.\n*   The fourth bar (for \"80-89\") with a height proportional to the frequency of 4.\n*   The fifth bar (for \"90-100\") with a height proportional to the frequency of 2.\n*   Adjacent bars (no gaps between them, characteristic of a histogram for continuous data intervals).\n*   A chart title (e.g., \"Exam Score Frequencies\" or \"Histogram of Exam Scores\")."
