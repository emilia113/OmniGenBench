  "Okay, here's the breakdown for the pie chart prompt.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately represent the specified data in the correct type of chart or plot format.\n*   **Specific Prompt:**\n    Construct a pie chart to represent time allocation in a student's day:\n    Activity Hours per Day\n    Sleep 8\n    Study 6\n    Leisure 4\n    Meals 2\n    Other 4\n\n**Procedure Application:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement & Prompt:**\n    *   The prompt specifies \"pie chart,\" so this is the \"correct type.\"\n    *   The data (Activities and Hours) must be \"accurately represented\" within this pie chart. This means slice proportions must match the hours, and labels must be correct.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   The overall chart type: `A pie chart structure`\n    *   The segments of the pie, corresponding to each activity. There are 5 activities, so 5 slices.\n        *   `A pie slice for \"Sleep\"` (its size must be proportional to 8/24 of the circle)\n        *   `A pie slice for \"Study\"` (its size must be proportional to 6/24 of the circle)\n        *   `A pie slice for \"Leisure\"` (its size must be proportional to 4/24 of the circle)\n        *   `A pie slice for \"Meals\"` (its size must be proportional to 2/24 of the circle)\n        *   `A pie slice for \"Other\"` (its size must be proportional to 4/24 of the circle)\n    *   Labels for each slice to identify the activity:\n        *   `Text label \"Sleep\"`\n        *   `Text label \"Study\"`\n        *   `Text label \"Leisure\"`\n        *   `Text label \"Meals\"`\n        *   `Text label \"Other\"`\n    *   Representation of the values (hours) for each slice, for clarity and accuracy:\n        *   `Numerical value \"8\" (or \"8 hours\") associated with the \"Sleep\" slice`\n        *   `Numerical value \"6\" (or \"6 hours\") associated with the \"Study\" slice`\n        *   `Numerical value \"4\" (or \"4 hours\") associated with the \"Leisure\" slice`\n        *   `Numerical value \"2\" (or \"2 hours\") associated with the \"Meals\" slice`\n        *   `Numerical value \"4\" (or \"4 hours\") associated with the \"Other\" slice`\n    *   To distinguish slices visually (essential for a pie chart):\n        *   `Distinct visual styling for each pie slice` (e.g., different colors or patterns)\n    *   A title to understand what the chart is about (derived from the prompt):\n        *   `A chart title (e.g., \"Time Allocation in a Student's Day\")`\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A pie chart structure\n*   A pie slice representing \"Sleep\"\n*   A pie slice representing \"Study\"\n*   A pie slice representing \"Leisure\"\n*   A pie slice representing \"Meals\"\n*   A pie slice representing \"Other\"\n*   Text label \"Sleep\" (associated with its corresponding slice)\n*   Text label \"Study\" (associated with its corresponding slice)\n*   Text label \"Leisure\" (associated with its corresponding slice)\n*   Text label \"Meals\" (associated with its corresponding slice)\n*   Text label \"Other\" (associated with its corresponding slice)\n*   Numerical data label \"8\" (or \"8 hours\") (associated with the \"Sleep\" slice/label)\n*   Numerical data label \"6\" (or \"6 hours\") (associated with the \"Study\" slice/label)\n*   Numerical data label \"4\" (or \"4 hours\") (associated with the \"Leisure\" slice/label)\n*   Numerical data label \"2\" (or \"2 hours\") (associated with the \"Meals\" slice/label)\n*   Numerical data label \"4\" (or \"4 hours\") (associated with the \"Other\" slice/label)\n*   Distinct visual styling for each pie slice (e.g., unique colors)\n*   A chart title indicating \"time allocation in a student's day\" (or similar phrasing from the prompt)"
