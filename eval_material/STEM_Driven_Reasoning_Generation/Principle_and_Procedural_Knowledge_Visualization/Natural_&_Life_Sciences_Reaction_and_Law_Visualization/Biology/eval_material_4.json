  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the phenylalanine diagram:\n\n*   Central alpha carbon atom\n*   Amino group (-NH2 or -NH3+) bonded to the alpha carbon\n*   Carboxyl group (-COOH or -COO-) bonded to the alpha carbon\n*   Hydrogen atom bonded to the alpha carbon\n*   Side chain (benzyl group) bonded to the alpha carbon, consisting of:\n    *   Methylene group (-CH2-)\n    *   Phenyl ring (C6H5) attached to the methylene group\n*   Atom symbols (C, H, N, O) for each respective atom\n*   Lines representing single bonds between atoms\n*   Lines representing double bonds (within the carboxyl group and phenyl ring, or delocalized pi system representation for the phenyl ring)\n*   Label identifying the molecule as \"Phenylalanine\"\n*   Label or clear visual demarcation for the \"amino group\"\n*   Label or clear visual demarcation for the \"carboxyl group\"\n*   Label or clear visual demarcation for the \"side chain\""
