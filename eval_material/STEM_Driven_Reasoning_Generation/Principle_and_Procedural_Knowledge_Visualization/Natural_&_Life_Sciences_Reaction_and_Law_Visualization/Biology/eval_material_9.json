["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specific biological process or stage described in the prompt, ensuring clarity and educational value.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled molecular diagram of the unwinding stage in DNA replication, showing helicase separating the double helix at the replication fork.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining the Key Requirement with the prompt, we need to identify the essential visual components for a clear, accurate, labeled diagram of DNA unwinding by helicase at the replication fork.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Parental DNA double helix (intact portion)\n*   Helicase enzyme (protein structure)\n*   Replication fork (Y-shaped junction)\n*   Two separated single DNA strands (resulting from unwinding)\n*   Label for \"Parental DNA double helix\"\n*   Label for \"Helicase\"\n*   Label for \"Replication fork\"\n*   Labels for \"Single DNA strand\" (or \"Separated DNA strands\")\n*   Arrow indicating direction of unwinding (or helicase movement)"]
