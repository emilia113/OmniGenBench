  "Okay, here's the breakdown based on the Key Requirement and the specific prompt.\n\n**Input:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specified components or structures relevant to the subject matter of each diagram.\n*   **Prompt:** Generate a labeled cross-sectional diagram of a flowering plant, showing roots, stem, and leaf arrangement.\n\n**Procedure & Element Identification:**\n\n1.  The subject is a \"flowering plant.\"\n2.  The diagram type is \"cross-sectional\" and must be \"labeled.\"\n3.  The components to be *shown* (and therefore depicted and labeled, per Key Requirement) are:\n    *   Roots\n    *   Stem\n    *   Leaf arrangement (which implies leaves must be visible)\n4.  The \"cross-sectional\" requirement means that the depiction of these components (especially roots and stem, where internal structure is typically shown in cross-sections) should reveal internal details or be presented as a cut view.\n5.  Labels are required for the specified components.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required visual elements:\n\n*   Plant root structures\n*   Plant stem structure\n*   Plant leaf structures\n*   Visible pattern of leaf arrangement on the stem\n*   Cross-sectional view detail of root(s)\n*   Cross-sectional view detail of stem\n*   Label text \"Roots\" (or similar, e.g., \"Root System\") pointing to root structures\n*   Label text \"Stem\" pointing to the stem structure\n*   Label text \"Leaf\" (or \"Leaves\") pointing to leaf structures\n*   Label text \"Leaf Arrangement\" (or similar, indicating the pattern)"
