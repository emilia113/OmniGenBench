["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specific biological process or stage described in the prompt, ensuring clarity and educational value.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a simplified diagram showing the glycolysis step in cellular respiration, with glucose breakdown into pyruvate and ATP generation.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining these, the image needs to be a *simplified diagram* of *glycolysis*, showing *glucose* breaking down into *pyruvate*, and also showing *ATP generation*. All key components must be *labeled* for clarity.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Representation of a glucose molecule (or a simplified shape for it)\n*   Label for \"Glucose\"\n*   Representation of pyruvate molecules (or simplified shapes, typically two resulting from one glucose)\n*   Label for \"Pyruvate\"\n*   Visual cue for ATP generation (e.g., an arrow pointing to \"ATP\" or \"+ ATP\")\n*   Label for \"ATP\" (or \"ATP produced\")\n*   Directional arrow(s) indicating the transformation from glucose to pyruvate\n*   A title or heading clearly stating \"Glycolysis\""]
