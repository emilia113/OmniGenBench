["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Key Requirement:** \"The image must accurately depict and label the specific biological process or stage described in the prompt, ensuring clarity and educational value.\"\n    *   This means we need correct biological structures for the stage.\n    *   Labels are mandatory for these structures.\n    *   The overall image should be clear and easy to understand, typical of an educational diagram.\n\n2.  **Specific Prompt:** \"Generate a labeled textbook-style diagram of metaphase in mitosis, showing chromosomes aligned at the cell\u2019s equator.\"\n    *   **Process/Stage:** Metaphase in mitosis.\n    *   **Key Feature 1:** Chromosomes aligned at the cell\u2019s equator (this implies the metaphase plate).\n    *   **Key Feature 2:** \"Labeled\" (reinforces Key Requirement).\n    *   **Style:** \"Textbook-style diagram\" (reinforces clarity and educational value).\n\n**Combining and Identifying Visual Elements:**\n\nTo depict metaphase in mitosis accurately and fulfill the prompt:\n\n*   We need a **cell**.\n*   Inside the cell, **chromosomes** must be visible. In metaphase, these are highly condensed and consist of two sister chromatids.\n*   These chromosomes must be **aligned at the cell's equator**, forming the **metaphase plate**.\n*   The **spindle apparatus** is crucial:\n    *   **Centrosomes** (in animal cells, which is the typical textbook example unless specified otherwise) at opposite poles of the cell.\n    *   **Spindle fibers** (microtubules) extending from the centrosomes and attaching to the chromosomes.\n*   **Labels** are required for all significant structures to ensure clarity and educational value.\n*   A **title** is standard for a textbook-style diagram.\n\n**Output from Part 2: A bullet list of required elements.**\n\n*   Cell outline (representing cell boundary/membrane)\n*   Condensed chromosomes (each clearly showing two sister chromatids)\n*   Metaphase plate (or Equatorial plate, where chromosomes are aligned)\n*   Spindle fibers (microtubules)\n*   Centrosomes (at opposite cell poles)\n*   Label for \"Cell membrane\" (or \"Plasma membrane\")\n*   Label for \"Chromosome\"\n*   Label for \"Sister chromatids\"\n*   Label for \"Centromere\" (on each chromosome)\n*   Label for \"Metaphase plate\" (or \"Equatorial plate\")\n*   Label for \"Spindle fibers\"\n*   Label for \"Centrosome\"\n*   Diagram title (e.g., \"Metaphase\" or \"Mitosis: Metaphase\")"]
