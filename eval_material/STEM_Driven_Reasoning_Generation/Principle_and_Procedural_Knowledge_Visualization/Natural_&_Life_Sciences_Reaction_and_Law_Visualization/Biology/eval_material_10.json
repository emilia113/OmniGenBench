["Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the prompt: \"Generate an educational diagram showing water evaporation from leaf stomata during plant transpiration.\"\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specific biological process or stage described in the prompt, ensuring clarity and educational value.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an educational diagram showing water evaporation from leaf stomata during plant transpiration.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining the Key Requirement with the prompt, we need to identify the essential visual components of a leaf cross-section that illustrate transpiration through stomata, along with necessary labels.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Leaf cross-section view\n*   Upper epidermis layer\n*   Cuticle layer (on epidermis)\n*   Palisade mesophyll cells (optional, but typical in leaf diagrams)\n*   Spongy mesophyll cells\n*   Air spaces within spongy mesophyll\n*   Lower epidermis layer\n*   Stoma (stomatal pore)\n*   Guard cells (pair, flanking the stoma, shown open)\n*   Xylem vessel (part of a vascular bundle, showing water source)\n*   Liquid water film on mesophyll cell surfaces\n*   Water vapor molecules (inside air spaces)\n*   Water vapor molecules (exiting the stoma)\n*   Arrows indicating water movement from xylem\n*   Arrows indicating water evaporation from cell surfaces into air spaces\n*   Arrows indicating water vapor diffusion out of the stoma\n*   Label for \"Stoma\" (or \"Stomatal Pore\")\n*   Label for \"Guard Cells\"\n*   Label for \"Water Vapor\"\n*   Label for \"Spongy Mesophyll Cells\"\n*   Label for \"Air Space\"\n*   Label for \"Cuticle\"\n*   Label for \"Epidermis\" (or \"Upper Epidermis\" and \"Lower Epidermis\")\n*   Label for \"Xylem\" (or \"Vascular Bundle\")\n*   Label for \"Liquid Water\" (on cell surfaces)"]
