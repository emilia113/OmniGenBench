  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict a specific biological process or interaction with appropriate labeling and detail.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled diagram showing ovulation in the female reproductive cycle, with the egg released from the ovary.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The core is a \"labeled diagram\" of \"ovulation.\" This means we need the key anatomical structures involved in ovulation, the event of egg release itself, and labels for these structures. The \"detail\" aspect from the Key Requirement implies showing not just a blob for an ovary, but some internal context if relevant (like follicles).\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Ovary:** The central organ where ovulation occurs.\n    *   **Egg (Ovum/Oocyte):** The cell being released.\n    *   **Ruptured Follicle:** The specific site on the ovary from which the egg is emerging. This shows the \"release\" mechanism.\n    *   **Mature Follicle (Graafian Follicle):** The structure within the ovary that matures and then ruptures to release the egg. Showing one pre-rupture or in the process of rupturing adds detail.\n    *   **Fallopian Tube (specifically the infundibulum with fimbriae):** The structure that \"catches\" the egg. Its proximity and interaction are key.\n    *   **Fimbriae:** The finger-like projections of the fallopian tube actively sweeping or near the ovary surface.\n    *   **Corpus Luteum (optional but good for \"cycle\" context):** The structure that the follicle becomes after ovulation. For a diagram showing the *process* of ovulation, this might be shown as a later stage or a remnant from a previous cycle within the ovary.\n    *   **Developing Follicles (various stages):** To show the ovary as an active organ with ongoing processes, fitting the \"cycle\" and \"detail\" aspects.\n    *   **Labels:** For each significant anatomical structure.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   An ovary.\n*   An egg (oocyte/ovum) being released.\n*   A ruptured follicle on the ovary surface.\n*   A mature follicle (Graafian follicle) visible within the ovary (possibly bulging or rupturing).\n*   The infundibulum of a fallopian tube.\n*   Fimbriae of the fallopian tube near the ovary.\n*   At least one developing follicle within the ovary.\n*   A corpus luteum within the ovary (representing a post-ovulation stage).\n*   Label for \"Ovary\".\n*   Label for \"Egg\" (or \"Oocyte\"/\"Ovum\").\n*   Label for \"Ruptured Follicle\" (or \"Ovulation site\").\n*   Label for \"Mature Follicle\" (or \"Graafian Follicle\").\n*   Label for \"Fallopian Tube\" (or \"Uterine Tube\").\n*   Label for \"Fimbriae\".\n*   Label for \"Corpus Luteum\".\n*   Label for \"Developing Follicle(s)\"."
