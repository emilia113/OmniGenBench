  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict a specific biological process or interaction with appropriate labeling and detail.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a diagram illustrating how insulin promotes glucose uptake in muscle cells after a meal.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine & Deconstruct:**\n    *   \"Diagram\": Implies schematic, not photorealistic. Labels are crucial.\n    *   \"Insulin\": A key molecule, needs visual representation.\n    *   \"Promotes glucose uptake\": The core process. Needs to show insulin's action leading to glucose entry.\n    *   \"Muscle cells\": The specific cell type. Needs to be identifiable as such, or at least as a generic cell with a membrane.\n    *   \"After a meal\": Context implying high blood glucose and insulin presence.\n    *   \"Accurately depict... appropriate labeling and detail\": Reinforces the need for correct biological structures and their names.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Cellular Environment:**\n        *   A muscle cell (or a representative cell section)\n        *   Muscle cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer)\n        *   Extracellular space (representing interstitial fluid/bloodstream)\n        *   Cytoplasm (intracellular space)\n\n    *   **Molecules & Receptors:**\n        *   Insulin molecules (shown extracellularly)\n        *   Insulin receptors (transmembrane proteins on the muscle cell membrane)\n        *   Glucose molecules (shown extracellularly, then intracellularly)\n        *   GLUT4 glucose transporters (initially in intracellular vesicles)\n        *   GLUT4 glucose transporters (translocated to and embedded in the cell membrane)\n\n    *   **Process Components:**\n        *   Intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 transporters\n        *   Visual representation of signal transduction pathway (e.g., arrows or simplified intermediate molecules activated by insulin receptor binding)\n        *   Visual indication of vesicle fusion with the cell membrane\n\n    *   **Labeling & Indicators (as per Key Requirement):**\n        *   Text labels for all key components (e.g., \"Insulin,\" \"Insulin Receptor,\" \"Glucose,\" \"GLUT4 Transporter,\" \"Muscle Cell Membrane,\" \"Vesicle\")\n        *   Directional arrows indicating movement (e.g., insulin binding, vesicle translocation, glucose entry)\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n\n*   A muscle cell representation\n*   Muscle cell membrane\n*   Extracellular space\n*   Cytoplasm\n*   Insulin molecules\n*   Insulin receptors on the cell membrane\n*   Glucose molecules (extracellular)\n*   GLUT4-containing intracellular vesicles\n*   GLUT4 transporters (within vesicles)\n*   GLUT4 transporters (embedded in the cell membrane)\n*   Visual cue for intracellular signaling pathway activation\n*   Glucose molecules (intracellular)\n*   Text labels for key biological components\n*   Directional arrows indicating process flow"
