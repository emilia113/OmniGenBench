  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict a specific biological process or interaction with appropriate labeling and detail.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a diagram showing airborne transmission of viruses via respiratory droplets from a cough.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine & Identify Core Concepts:**\n    *   \"Diagram\": Implies clarity, possibly stylized, with explanatory elements.\n    *   \"Airborne transmission\": Particles suspended and moving through the air.\n    *   \"Viruses\": The infectious agent, needs to be visualized.\n    *   \"Respiratory droplets\": The vehicle for the viruses, expelled from the respiratory system.\n    *   \"From a cough\": The source event, implying a human figure.\n    *   \"Accurately depict\": Scientific correctness in the process.\n    *   \"Appropriate labeling\": Text identifiers for key parts.\n    *   \"Detail\": Not overly simplistic; showing necessary distinctions (e.g., perhaps different droplet sizes if relevant to \"airborne\").\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Source of cough:** A human is needed.\n        *   *Element:* `Human figure (or profile of head/upper torso) in the act of coughing`\n    *   **Expelled matter:** The droplets themselves.\n        *   *Element:* `Visible plume of respiratory droplets emanating from the coughing figure's mouth/nose`\n    *   **Infectious agent:** The viruses within the droplets.\n        *   *Element:* `Visual representation of virus particles within the respiratory droplets`\n    *   **Airborne nature & detail:** \"Airborne\" implies smaller particles can travel further. \"Detail\" and \"accuracy\" would support showing this.\n        *   *Element:* `Representation of different sized respiratory droplets (larger droplets and smaller aerosolized particles)`\n        *   *Element:* `Smaller aerosolized particles shown suspended and traveling in the air` (distinct from larger droplets that might fall more quickly)\n    *   **Process indication (for a diagram):** How is transmission shown?\n        *   *Element:* `Arrows indicating the direction of travel for droplets and aerosols`\n    *   **Labeling (Key Requirement):**\n        *   *Element:* `Labels for key components (e.g., \"Coughing Person\", \"Respiratory Droplets\", \"Virus Particles\", \"Aerosols\")`\n\n3.  **Review for Uncertainty:**\n    *   Is a second person (recipient) *required* by the prompt? No, it says \"showing airborne transmission... *from* a cough,\" not necessarily *to* someone. The focus is on the mechanism of release and travel. So, no recipient person.\n    *   Are specific types of viruses needed? No, just \"viruses.\"\n    *   Is a specific background needed? No, the focus is on the biological process.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Human figure (or profile of head/upper torso) depicting a cough\n*   Visible plume of respiratory droplets emanating from the coughing figure\n*   Visual representation of virus particles contained within the respiratory droplets\n*   Representation of varying sizes of respiratory droplets (e.g., larger droplets, smaller aerosolized particles)\n*   Smaller aerosolized particles shown suspended and traveling through the air\n*   Arrows indicating the direction of travel for droplets and aerosols\n*   Clear labels for key elements (e.g., \"Coughing Person\", \"Respiratory Droplets\", \"Virus Particles\", \"Aerosols\", \"Direction of Travel\")"
