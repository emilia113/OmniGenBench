  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict a specific biological process or interaction with appropriate labeling and detail.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a diagram showing a macrophage presenting an antigen to a helper T cell during an immune response.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be an *accurate diagram* of a *macrophage presenting an antigen to a helper T cell*. This means showing the key cellular structures involved in this specific interaction, the molecules mediating it, and clear labels for these components. \"Detail\" implies not just showing two cells touching, but the specific molecular interface.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   **Cells:**\n        *   Macrophage cell\n        *   Helper T cell\n    *   **Key molecules on Macrophage involved in presentation:**\n        *   MHC class II molecule (on macrophage surface)\n        *   Antigen fragment (presented within the MHC class II molecule)\n    *   **Key molecules on Helper T cell involved in recognition:**\n        *   T-cell receptor (TCR) (on helper T cell surface, binding to MHC-II/antigen complex)\n        *   CD4 co-receptor (on helper T cell surface, binding to MHC class II molecule)\n    *   **Interaction:**\n        *   Physical interaction site (showing close apposition of the two cells at the point of molecular engagement)\n    *   **Labels (as per Key Requirement for \"appropriate labeling\"):**\n        *   Label for \"Macrophage\"\n        *   Label for \"Helper T cell\"\n        *   Label for \"MHC class II molecule\"\n        *   Label for \"Antigen\" (or \"Antigen fragment\")\n        *   Label for \"T-cell receptor (TCR)\"\n        *   Label for \"CD4 co-receptor\"\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Macrophage cell\n*   Helper T cell\n*   MHC class II molecule on macrophage surface\n*   Antigen fragment bound to MHC class II molecule\n*   T-cell receptor (TCR) on helper T cell surface\n*   CD4 co-receptor on helper T cell surface\n*   Interaction site between macrophage and helper T cell\n*   Label for \"Macrophage\"\n*   Label for \"Helper T cell\"\n*   Label for \"MHC class II\"\n*   Label for \"Antigen\"\n*   Label for \"T-cell receptor (TCR)\"\n*   Label for \"CD4\""
