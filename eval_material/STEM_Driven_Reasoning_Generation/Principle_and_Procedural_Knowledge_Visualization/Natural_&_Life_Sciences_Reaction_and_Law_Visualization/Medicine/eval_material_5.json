  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict a specific biological process or interaction with appropriate labeling and detail.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled diagram illustrating the ventricular systole phase of the cardiac cycle, showing changes in left and right ventricular volume and pressure during contraction.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining the Key Requirement and the Specific Prompt, we need to identify concrete visual elements for a diagram of ventricular systole.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A representation of the human heart (cross-section)\n*   Left ventricle (depicted in a contracted state)\n*   Right ventricle (depicted in a contracted state)\n*   Left atrium\n*   Right atrium\n*   Aorta\n*   Pulmonary artery\n*   Mitral valve (atrioventricular valve) depicted in a closed state\n*   Tricuspid valve (atrioventricular valve) depicted in a closed state\n*   Aortic valve (semilunar valve) depicted in an open state\n*   Pulmonary valve (semilunar valve) depicted in an open state\n*   Directional arrows indicating blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta\n*   Directional arrows indicating blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery\n*   Visual indicator of high pressure within the left ventricle\n*   Visual indicator of high pressure within the right ventricle\n*   Visual indicator of decreased blood volume within the left ventricle\n*   Visual indicator of decreased blood volume within the right ventricle\n*   Label for \"Left Ventricle\"\n*   Label for \"Right Ventricle\"\n*   Label for \"Left Atrium\"\n*   Label for \"Right Atrium\"\n*   Label for \"Aorta\"\n*   Label for \"Pulmonary Artery\"\n*   Label for \"Mitral Valve (closed)\"\n*   Label for \"Tricuspid Valve (closed)\"\n*   Label for \"Aortic Valve (open)\"\n*   Label for \"Pulmonary Valve (open)\"\n*   Label or annotation indicating \"High Pressure\" for left ventricle\n*   Label or annotation indicating \"High Pressure\" for right ventricle\n*   Label or annotation indicating \"Decreased Volume\" for left ventricle\n*   Label or annotation indicating \"Decreased Volume\" for right ventricle\n*   A title for the diagram (e.g., \"Ventricular Systole\")"
