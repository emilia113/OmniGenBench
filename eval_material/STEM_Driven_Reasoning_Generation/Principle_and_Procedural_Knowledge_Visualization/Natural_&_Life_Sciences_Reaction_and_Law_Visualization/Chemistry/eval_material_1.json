  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the molecular-level changes and interactions occurring during each specified chemical reaction.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a molecular-level diagram showing the neutralization of hydrochloric acid by sodium hydroxide, forming water and sodium chloride.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to show, at a molecular level, how HCl and NaOH react to form H₂O and NaCl. This means representing the individual ions and molecules involved before and after the reaction, and implying their interaction.\n\n    *   Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in solution exists as H⁺ ions and Cl⁻ ions.\n    *   Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in solution exists as Na⁺ ions and OH⁻ ions.\n    *   Water (H₂O) is a molecule.\n    *   Sodium chloride (NaCl) in solution exists as Na⁺ ions and Cl⁻ ions.\n\n    The core reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n    The Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are spectator ions.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    To depict this accurately at the molecular level, we need to see:\n    *   The reactants before they combine.\n    *   The products after they form.\n\n    Therefore, the distinct visual entities that *must* be present to show this transformation are:\n\n    *   **Hydrogen ion (H⁺)**: Representing the acidic proton from HCl.\n    *   **Chloride ion (Cl⁻)**: Representing the anion from HCl (and also present with NaCl).\n    *   **Sodium ion (Na⁺)**: Representing the cation from NaOH (and also present with NaCl).\n    *   **Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)**: Representing the base from NaOH.\n    *   **Water molecule (H₂O)**: Representing the product of neutralization.\n\n    These elements need to be visually distinct (e.g., different colors/sizes for atoms, clear bonding in molecules/polyatomic ions). The image should show H⁺ and OH⁻ combining to form H₂O, with Na⁺ and Cl⁻ remaining as ions.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Hydrogen ion (H⁺)\n*   Chloride ion (Cl⁻)\n*   Sodium ion (Na⁺)\n*   Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)\n*   Water molecule (H₂O)"
