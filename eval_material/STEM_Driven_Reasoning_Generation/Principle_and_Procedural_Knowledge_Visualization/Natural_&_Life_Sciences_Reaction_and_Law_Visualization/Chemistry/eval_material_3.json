  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the molecular-level changes and interactions occurring during each specified chemical reaction.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a stepwise reaction diagram showing thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide under heat.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining these, the image needs to show:\n1.  Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) at the molecular level.\n2.  Heat being applied.\n3.  The process of CaCO₃ breaking down.\n4.  Calcium oxide (CaO) forming at the molecular level.\n5.  Carbon dioxide (CO₂) forming at the molecular level.\n6.  This should be presented as a \"stepwise reaction diagram,\" implying a clear progression.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required concrete visual elements:\n\n*   Molecular representation of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)\n*   Molecular representation of calcium oxide (CaO)\n*   Molecular representation of carbon dioxide (CO₂)\n*   Individual calcium atom (Ca) representation (as part of the molecules)\n*   Individual carbon atom (C) representation (as part of the molecules)\n*   Individual oxygen atom (O) representations (as part of the molecules)\n*   Visual representation of bonds within the initial calcium carbonate structure\n*   Visual representation of bonds within the final calcium oxide structure\n*   Visual representation of bonds within the final carbon dioxide structure\n*   A symbol or visual cue indicating heat input (e.g., a delta symbol Δ, a flame icon, or wavy heat lines)\n*   Reaction arrow(s) indicating the direction and progression of the reaction\n*   Visual depiction of bond-breaking process in calcium carbonate\n*   Visual depiction of bond-forming process for calcium oxide\n*   Visual depiction of bond-forming process for carbon dioxide\n*   Text label for \"Calcium Carbonate\" (or \"CaCO₃\")\n*   Text label for \"Calcium Oxide\" (or \"CaO\")\n*   Text label for \"Carbon Dioxide\" (or \"CO₂\")\n*   Clear visual separation or indication of the \"reactant\" stage (CaCO₃)\n*   Clear visual separation or indication of the \"product\" stage (CaO + CO₂)"
