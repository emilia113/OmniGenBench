  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the molecular-level changes and interactions occurring during each specified chemical reaction.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a reaction diagram showing hydrogen gas reacting with oxygen to form water vapor, focusing on bond breaking and bond formation.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining these, the image needs to show:\n1.  The molecules involved (H₂, O₂, H₂O) at an atomic level.\n2.  The bonds within these molecules.\n3.  The process of the original bonds (H-H, O=O) breaking.\n4.  The process of new bonds (O-H) forming.\n5.  A clear indication of reactants, products, and the reaction progression.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required concrete visual elements:\n\n*   Hydrogen atoms (represented distinctly, e.g., by color/size)\n*   Oxygen atoms (represented distinctly from hydrogen atoms, e.g., by color/size)\n*   Hydrogen molecules (H₂) on the reactant side, showing two bonded hydrogen atoms\n*   Oxygen molecules (O₂) on the reactant side, showing two bonded oxygen atoms\n*   Water molecules (H₂O) on the product side, showing one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms\n*   Visual representation of H-H bonds breaking\n*   Visual representation of O=O bonds breaking (or O-O if single bonds are shown breaking sequentially, though O₂ has a double bond)\n*   Visual representation of O-H bonds forming\n*   Reaction progression indicator (e.g., a reaction arrow pointing from reactants to products)"
