  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the molecular-level changes and interactions occurring during each specified chemical reaction.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a molecular-level diagram showing zinc displacing copper from copper sulfate solution, forming zinc sulfate and solid copper.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    We need a molecular-level view. This means individual atoms, ions, and molecules.\n    The reaction is: Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)\n    At the ionic/molecular level:\n    Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → Zn²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) + Cu(s)\n    Water (H₂O) molecules will be present as the solvent for the aqueous solutions.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   Solid Zinc: A collection of zinc atoms (Zn) arranged in a metallic lattice.\n        *   Copper Sulfate Solution:\n            *   Copper(II) ions (Cu²⁺) dissolved in water.\n            *   Sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) dissolved in water.\n            *   Water molecules (H₂O) as the solvent, surrounding the ions.\n    *   **Products:**\n        *   Solid Copper: A collection of copper atoms (Cu), likely forming on the surface of the remaining zinc or as distinct particles.\n        *   Zinc Sulfate Solution:\n            *   Zinc ions (Zn²⁺) dissolved in water.\n            *   Sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) dissolved in water (these are spectator ions).\n            *   Water molecules (H₂O) as the solvent.\n    *   **Interactions/Changes (to satisfy \"molecular-level changes and interactions\"):**\n        *   The interface where solid zinc meets the copper sulfate solution.\n        *   A visual representation of zinc atoms (Zn) from the solid losing electrons and becoming zinc ions (Zn²⁺) entering the solution.\n        *   A visual representation of copper(II) ions (Cu²⁺) from the solution gaining electrons and becoming copper atoms (Cu) depositing as a solid.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Zinc atoms in a solid lattice structure (reactant).\n*   Copper(II) ions (Cu²⁺) in aqueous solution (reactant).\n*   Sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) in aqueous solution (reactant and product, spectator ion).\n*   Water molecules (H₂O) as solvent.\n*   Zinc ions (Zn²⁺) in aqueous solution (product).\n*   Copper atoms forming a solid structure (product).\n*   Interface between solid zinc and the aqueous solution.\n*   Visual indication of zinc atoms transitioning to zinc ions at the interface.\n*   Visual indication of copper(II) ions transitioning to copper atoms at the interface."
