  "Okay, here's the breakdown for the Leo constellation star map prompt.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict astronomical phenomena or celestial events with appropriate labeling and visual clarity.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a star map of the Leo constellation as seen from Earth, showing labeled major stars and connecting lines.\n\n**Procedure & Identification:**\n\n1.  **\"Star map\"**: Implies a background representing space.\n    *   Element: Dark background representing space.\n2.  **\"Leo constellation\"**: The specific group of stars.\n    *   Element: Stars forming the Leo constellation pattern.\n3.  **\"as seen from Earth\"**: Reinforces the accuracy of the star positions relative to each other.\n    *   Element: Accurate relative positions of Leo's stars.\n4.  **\"major stars\"**: Not all stars, but the prominent ones. Their visual representation should reflect their prominence (e.g., brightness/size).\n    *   Element: Visual representation of major stars in Leo (e.g., Regulus, Denebola, Algieba).\n    *   Element: Differentiation in visual brightness/size for major stars.\n5.  **\"labeled major stars\"**: Text labels for these prominent stars. \"Appropriate labeling\" and \"visual clarity\" from Key Requirement apply here.\n    *   Element: Text labels for major stars.\n    *   Element: Legible font for labels.\n6.  **\"connecting lines\"**: Lines drawn between stars to show the constellation figure. \"Accurately depict\" from Key Requirement applies.\n    *   Element: Lines connecting specific stars to form the Leo asterism.\n7.  **\"visual clarity\" (from Key Requirement)**: Ensures the map is understandable.\n    *   Element: Clear distinction between stars, lines, labels, and background.\n8.  **\"appropriate labeling\" (from Key Requirement)**: While individual stars are labeled, the map itself should ideally indicate what constellation it is.\n    *   Element: Constellation name \"Leo\" as a title or label.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Dark background representing space.\n*   Stars forming the Leo constellation pattern.\n*   Accurate relative positions of Leo's stars.\n*   Visual representation of major stars in Leo (e.g., Regulus, Denebola, Algieba).\n*   Differentiation in visual brightness/size for major stars.\n*   Text labels for major stars.\n*   Legible font for labels.\n*   Lines connecting specific stars to form the Leo asterism.\n*   Clear distinction between stars, lines, labels, and background.\n*   Constellation name \"Leo\" as a title or label."
