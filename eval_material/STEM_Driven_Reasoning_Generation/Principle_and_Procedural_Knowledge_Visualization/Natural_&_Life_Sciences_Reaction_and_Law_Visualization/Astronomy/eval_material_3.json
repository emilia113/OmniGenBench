  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict astronomical phenomena or celestial events with appropriate labeling and visual clarity.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a space illustration showing the moment of a core-collapse supernova explosion of a massive star with outer layers ejecting into space.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be a space illustration of a core-collapse supernova. This means it must visually represent:\n    *   The \"moment of explosion\" – implying intense energy release.\n    *   A \"massive star\" as the progenitor (though we're seeing it *explode*, so its prior form isn't the focus, but the origin point is).\n    *   \"Outer layers ejecting into space\" – this is a key visual.\n    *   It must be \"accurate\" for a core-collapse supernova.\n    *   It must have \"visual clarity.\"\n    *   The Key Requirement mentions \"appropriate labeling.\" However, the prompt itself doesn't request labels for this specific illustration of an *event*. For an *event* like an explosion, labels might detract from the visual impact unless it's specifically a diagram. Given the instruction \"Do not include any uncertain visual elements to Key Requirement,\" and since the prompt doesn't ask for labels, I will prioritize the direct visual elements of the phenomenon itself. If the prompt were, for example, \"a diagram of a supernova's structure,\" labels would be essential. Here, the focus is on the *visual depiction of the event*.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   The central point of the explosion: This is where the massive star's core collapsed. It should be intensely bright.\n    *   The shockwave: A rapidly expanding front of energy and matter.\n    *   The ejecta: The outer layers of the star being violently expelled. This material will likely be non-uniform, possibly showing structure.\n    *   The surrounding space: To provide context.\n    *   Distant stars: To establish it's in space and give a sense of scale/depth.\n\n3.  **Write as Short Noun Phrases:**\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n*   Intensely bright central point of explosion\n*   Expanding, luminous shockwave front\n*   Outward-erupting stellar material (ejecta)\n*   Filamentary or clumpy structures within the ejecta\n*   Dark interstellar space background\n*   Unaffected distant stars"
