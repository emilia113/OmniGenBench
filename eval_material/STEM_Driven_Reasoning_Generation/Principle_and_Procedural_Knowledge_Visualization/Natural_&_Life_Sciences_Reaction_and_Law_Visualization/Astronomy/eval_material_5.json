  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict astronomical phenomena or celestial events with appropriate labeling and visual clarity.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a night-sky illustration showing Geminid meteors streaking across the sky.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    *   The image needs to be a night-sky illustration.\n    *   It must show Geminid meteors.\n    *   These meteors must be \"streaking across the sky.\"\n    *   The depiction of these meteors (an astronomical phenomenon/celestial event) must be accurate.\n    *   There must be appropriate labeling (for the Geminid meteors).\n    *   The overall image must have visual clarity.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Night sky background:** Essential for a \"night-sky illustration.\"\n    *   **Stars:** Implied by \"night-sky\" and \"astronomical phenomena.\" A night sky without stars would be unusual and not \"accurate.\"\n    *   **Multiple meteor streaks:** \"Geminid meteors\" (plural) \"streaking.\"\n    *   **Appearance of meteors originating from a general area (radiant effect):** For \"Geminid meteors\" to be depicted \"accurately,\" they should appear to radiate from a point (near Gemini, though the constellation itself isn't explicitly required by the prompt, the radiant effect is characteristic of a meteor shower).\n    *   **Label identifying \"Geminid Meteors\" (or \"Geminids\"):** From \"appropriate labeling\" applied to the specific \"Geminid meteors\" in the prompt.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Night sky background\n*   Visible stars\n*   Multiple meteor streaks\n*   Apparent radiant point for meteors\n*   Text label for \"Geminid Meteors\""
