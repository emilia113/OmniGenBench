  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict astronomical phenomena or celestial events with appropriate labeling and visual clarity.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a telescope-style illustration of Venus appearing as a dark disk crossing the bright solar surface during its transit.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt Details:**\n    *   \"Telescope-style illustration\": Implies a specific framing, perhaps a circular view, and an illustrative (not necessarily photorealistic) quality.\n    *   \"Venus appearing as a dark disk\": Venus must be a silhouette, circular, and dark.\n    *   \"crossing the bright solar surface\": The Sun must be depicted as a bright surface, and Venus must be on top of it, not beside or behind.\n    *   \"during its transit\": Reinforces the astronomical event.\n    *   \"accurately depict\": Relative sizes (Sun much larger than Venus) should be generally correct. The phenomenon itself (dark disk on bright star) is key.\n    *   \"appropriate labeling\": The key celestial bodies involved should be labeled.\n    *   \"visual clarity\": The elements should be distinct and easy to see.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   The Sun's surface: It needs to be bright and form the background for Venus.\n    *   Venus: It needs to be a dark disk, smaller than the Sun.\n    *   The positioning: Venus must be on the Sun's disk.\n    *   The \"telescope-style\": This suggests a particular framing, often circular.\n    *   Labels: For Venus and the Sun.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Bright, large, circular disk (representing the Sun's surface)\n*   Dark, small, circular silhouette (representing Venus)\n*   Venus silhouette superimposed on the solar disk\n*   Telescope-style circular view/framing\n*   Label identifying \"Venus\"\n*   Label identifying \"Sun\" (or \"Solar Surface\")"
