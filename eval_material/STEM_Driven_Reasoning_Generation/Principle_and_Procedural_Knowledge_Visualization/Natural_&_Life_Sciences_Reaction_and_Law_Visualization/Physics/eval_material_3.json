  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the ray diagram:\n\n*   **Convex lens symbol** (typically a vertical line with outward-pointing arrowheads at top and bottom, or a bi-convex shape)\n*   **Principal axis line** (a horizontal line passing through the center of the lens)\n*   **Optical center point (O)** (the center of the lens where it intersects the principal axis)\n*   **Principal focus point (F1 or F) on the object side of the lens**\n*   **Principal focus point (F2 or F') on the image side of the lens**\n*   **Point 2F1 (or 2F) on the object side of the lens** (at twice the focal length from O)\n*   **Point 2F2 (or 2F') on the image side of the lens** (at twice the focal length from O)\n*   **Upright object arrow** (placed to the left of point 2F1 on the principal axis)\n*   **Incident light ray from the object's tip, parallel to the principal axis**\n*   **Refracted light ray from the parallel incident ray, passing through F2 (or F')**\n*   **Incident light ray from the object's tip, passing through the optical center (O)**\n*   **Refracted light ray (undeflected) continuing from the ray passing through O**\n*   **(Optional but highly recommended for completeness) Incident light ray from the object's tip, passing through F1 (or F)**\n*   **(Optional but highly recommended for completeness) Refracted light ray from the F1-incident ray, emerging parallel to the principal axis**\n*   **Inverted image arrow** (formed at the intersection of the refracted rays, located between F2 and 2F2)\n*   **Directional arrows on all light rays** (indicating the path of light)\n*   **Label for the object** (e.g., \"Object\" or \"AB\")\n*   **Label for the image** (e.g., \"Image\" or \"A'B'\")\n*   **Label for the convex lens** (e.g., \"Lens\")\n*   **Labels for both principal foci** (e.g., \"F1\", \"F2\" or \"F\", \"F'\")\n*   **Labels for both 2F points** (e.g., \"2F1\", \"2F2\" or \"2F\", \"2F'\")\n*   **Label for the optical center** (e.g., \"O\")"
