  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific concept or process with clearly labeled components.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a field line diagram showing the magnetic field around a bar magnet, with lines exiting the north pole and entering the south pole.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be a scientifically accurate field line diagram of a bar magnet. This means showing the magnet itself, its poles, and the magnetic field lines with correct directionality. Crucially, the \"components\" (the poles) must be clearly labeled.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   The magnet itself: **A bar magnet**.\n    *   The poles of the magnet: These need to be visually distinct areas on the magnet.\n        *   **A North pole on the magnet**.\n        *   **A South pole on the magnet**.\n    *   Labels for the poles (from Key Requirement \"clearly labeled components\"):\n        *   **A label for the North pole** (e.g., \"N\" or \"North\").\n        *   **A label for the South pole** (e.g., \"S\" or \"South\").\n    *   The magnetic field: Represented by lines.\n        *   **Multiple magnetic field lines**.\n    *   Directionality of lines (from prompt \"exiting the north pole and entering the south pole\"):\n        *   **Field lines depicted exiting the North pole**.\n        *   **Field lines depicted entering the South pole**.\n        *   **Arrows on the field lines** (to show direction from North to South externally).\n    *   Overall pattern of lines (implied by \"field line diagram\" and \"around a bar magnet\"):\n        *   **Field lines forming continuous loops** (from North to South externally, and implicitly through the magnet).\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A bar magnet\n*   An identifiable North pole on the magnet\n*   An identifiable South pole on the magnet\n*   A label for the North pole\n*   A label for the South pole\n*   Multiple magnetic field lines\n*   Field lines shown exiting the North pole\n*   Field lines shown entering the South pole\n*   Directional arrows on the field lines (pointing away from North and towards South, externally)\n*   Field lines forming continuous loops around the magnet (externally from North to South)"
