  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific concept or process with clearly labeled components.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a simplified diagram of a linear particle accelerator showing electron injection and acceleration stages.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be a *simplified diagram* of a *linear particle accelerator*. It must *accurately depict* the *electron injection stage* and the *acceleration stages*. All key *components* involved in these stages must be *clearly labeled*.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Electron Source/Injector:** This is where the \"electron injection\" begins.\n        *   *Visual element:* Electron source (or injector unit).\n        *   *Label:* \"Electron Source\" (or \"Injector\").\n    *   **Linear Accelerator Structure:** The main body where acceleration happens.\n        *   *Visual element:* A long, straight tube or series of connected segments representing the accelerator path.\n        *   *Label:* \"Linear Accelerator Tube\" (or \"Accelerator Structure,\" \"Beamline\").\n    *   **Electrons:** The particles being accelerated.\n        *   *Visual element:* Representation of electrons (e.g., a beam, a series of dots) moving from the injector through the accelerator.\n        *   *Label:* \"Electron Beam\" (or \"Electrons\").\n    *   **Acceleration Stages/Mechanism:** The parts within the accelerator that cause acceleration. In a simplified diagram, this could be represented by segments or symbolic representations of RF cavities or drift tubes.\n        *   *Visual element:* Distinct sections or components along the accelerator tube that represent the accelerating fields/structures.\n        *   *Label:* \"Accelerating Structures\" (or \"RF Cavities,\" \"Drift Tubes,\" or a general \"Acceleration Stage\"). If multiple distinct stages are shown, they might be individually or collectively labeled.\n    *   **Indication of Injection Area:** To clearly show the \"electron injection stage.\"\n        *   *Visual element:* The region around the electron source where electrons enter the main accelerator.\n        *   *Label:* \"Injection Stage\" (or an arrow pointing to this area with the label).\n    *   **Indication of Acceleration Area/Process:** To clearly show the \"acceleration stages.\"\n        *   *Visual element:* The region(s) along the accelerator tube where the accelerating structures are located.\n        *   *Label:* \"Acceleration Stage(s)\" (or an arrow/bracket indicating this region).\n    *   **Direction of Travel/Acceleration:** Essential for understanding the process.\n        *   *Visual element:* Arrow(s) showing the direction of electron movement and acceleration.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Electron source (or injector unit)\n*   Linear accelerator tube (or structure)\n*   Electrons (depicted as a beam or particles)\n*   Accelerating structures (e.g., symbolic RF cavities or drift tubes)\n*   Label for \"Electron Source\" (or \"Injector\")\n*   Label for \"Linear Accelerator Tube\" (or \"Accelerator Structure\")\n*   Label for \"Electron Beam\"\n*   Label for \"Accelerating Structures\" (or specific type like \"RF Cavity\")\n*   Label indicating \"Injection Stage\" (area/process)\n*   Label indicating \"Acceleration Stage(s)\" (area/process)\n*   Arrow indicating direction of electron travel/acceleration"
