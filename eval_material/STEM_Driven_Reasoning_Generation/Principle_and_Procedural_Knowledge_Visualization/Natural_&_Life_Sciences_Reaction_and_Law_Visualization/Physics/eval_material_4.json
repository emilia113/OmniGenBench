  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the mass-spring system diagram.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific concept or process with clearly labeled components.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a diagram showing a mass-spring system oscillating on a frictionless surface, with position, velocity, and restoring force labeled at one phase.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A block (representing the mass).\n*   A helical spring.\n*   A fixed anchor point for one end of the spring (e.g., a wall).\n*   The other end of the spring attached to the mass.\n*   A horizontal surface beneath the mass.\n*   The mass shown displaced from an equilibrium position (spring either stretched or compressed).\n*   A reference marker or line indicating the equilibrium position.\n*   A label for \"Position\" (or \"x\") with an associated arrow or indicator showing displacement from equilibrium.\n*   A vector arrow indicating \"Velocity\" originating from the mass.\n*   A text label for \"Velocity\" (or \"v\") associated with the velocity vector.\n*   A vector arrow indicating \"Restoring Force\" originating from the mass.\n*   A text label for \"Restoring Force\" (or \"F\" or \"F_s\") associated with the force vector."
