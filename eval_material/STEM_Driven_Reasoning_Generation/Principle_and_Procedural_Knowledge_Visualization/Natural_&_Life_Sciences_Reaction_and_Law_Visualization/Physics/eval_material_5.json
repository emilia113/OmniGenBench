  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the prompt: \"Generate a conceptual diagram showing a single particle in superposition between two slits before measurement,\" combined with the Key Requirement: \"The image must accurately depict the specified scientific concept or process with clearly labeled components.\"\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A solid barrier structure.\n*   Two distinct, parallel slit openings within the barrier.\n*   A single wave form (representing the particle's probability amplitude).\n*   The wave form depicted as having passed through *both* slit openings simultaneously.\n*   The wave form shown propagating and expanding in the region *after* (beyond) the barrier and slits.\n*   A clear label for the \"Barrier\".\n*   Clear labels for each \"Slit\" (e.g., \"Slit 1\", \"Slit 2\" or \"Left Slit\", \"Right Slit\").\n*   A clear label for the wave form (e.g., \"Particle's Wave Function\", \"Probability Wave\", or \"Particle in Superposition\").\n*   An explicit absence of a detection screen or measurement device in the path of the propagating wave."
