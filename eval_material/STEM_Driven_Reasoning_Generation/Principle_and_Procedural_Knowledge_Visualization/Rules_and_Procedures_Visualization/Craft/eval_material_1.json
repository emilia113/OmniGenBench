  "Here is a bullet list of required concrete visual elements for the image:\n\n*   A bowl suitable for dough fermentation.\n*   An initial mass of unrisen dough within the bowl.\n*   A cover (e.g., cloth, plastic wrap) placed over the bowl containing the unrisen dough.\n*   The same bowl now containing bulk-fermented dough, visibly larger in volume than its initial state.\n*   A distinct, shaped form of dough (e.g., loaf, buns) after the bulk fermentation and shaping process.\n*   A proofing vessel or surface (e.g., loaf pan, baking sheet, banneton) holding the shaped dough.\n*   A cover (e.g., cloth, plastic wrap) placed over the shaped dough in its proofing vessel.\n*   The shaped dough in its proofing vessel, visibly larger and puffier after the proofing stage (second fermentation)."
