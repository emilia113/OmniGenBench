  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must depict a vehicle committing a traffic violation in a clearly identifiable manner.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a roadside illustration showing a car illegally overtaking another vehicle by crossing a solid centerline on a two-way road.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine & Identify Key Visuals from Prompt:**\n    *   \"roadside illustration\": Implies the presence of a road and its immediate surroundings (e.g., shoulder, grass, perhaps some background).\n    *   \"a car illegally overtaking\": This is the primary violating vehicle.\n    *   \"another vehicle\": This is the vehicle being overtaken.\n    *   \"crossing a solid centerline\": This is the specific visual evidence of the violation. The line itself must be solid, and the overtaking car must be shown on the wrong side of it.\n    *   \"on a two-way road\": Defines the road type and the function of the centerline.\n\n2.  **Ensure Key Requirement is Met:**\n    *   \"Vehicle committing a traffic violation\": The \"overtaking car\" is the vehicle. The \"crossing a solid centerline to overtake\" is the violation.\n    *   \"Clearly identifiable manner\": The solid centerline and the car's position relative to it (and the other vehicle) must make the violation unambiguous.\n\n3.  **List Distinct Visual Elements as Short Noun Phrases:**\n\n    *   An overtaking car (the violator)\n    *   An overtaken vehicle\n    *   A solid centerline (road marking)\n    *   A two-way road surface\n    *   The overtaking car positioned across (or partially across) the solid centerline\n    *   Roadside environment (e.g., shoulder, grass, simple scenery)\n\nLet's refine the phrasing to be very direct noun phrases for elements:\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n*   An overtaking car\n*   An overtaken vehicle\n*   A solid centerline road marking\n*   A two-way road surface\n*   Roadside visual elements (e.g., grass, shoulder)"
