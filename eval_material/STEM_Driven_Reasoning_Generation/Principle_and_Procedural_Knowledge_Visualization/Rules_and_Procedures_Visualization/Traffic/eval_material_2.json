  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must depict a vehicle committing a traffic violation in a clearly identifiable manner.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image illustrating a vehicle driving significantly faster than the posted speed limit.\n\n**Combined Understanding:**\nThe image needs to show a vehicle, a posted speed limit, and a clear indication that the vehicle is exceeding that limit significantly. The \"clearly identifiable manner\" means the violation (speeding) must be unambiguous.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A vehicle\n*   A road or driving environment\n*   A legible posted speed limit sign\n*   A visual indicator of the vehicle's actual speed (e.g., a speed camera display, a police radar gun reading, or a speedometer clearly visible and contrasting with the sign)\n*   Visual cues of the vehicle's high speed (e.g., motion blur, speed lines)"
