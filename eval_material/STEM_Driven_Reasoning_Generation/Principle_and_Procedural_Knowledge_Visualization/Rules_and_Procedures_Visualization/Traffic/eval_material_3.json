  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must depict a vehicle committing a traffic violation in a clearly identifiable manner.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image illustrating illegal U-turn at a busy intersection.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Specific Prompt:**\n    The image needs to show a vehicle making an illegal U-turn. The illegality must be clear. The setting is a busy intersection.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   To show a \"vehicle committing a traffic violation\":\n        *   A vehicle (e.g., car, truck, van).\n        *   This vehicle must be in the act of making a U-turn.\n    *   To show the violation is \"clearly identifiable\" and \"illegal\":\n        *   A \"No U-turn\" sign (the most direct way to show the U-turn is illegal).\n        *   Alternatively, or additionally, road markings that prohibit U-turns (e.g., solid double yellow lines being crossed, specific U-turn prohibition markings if they exist in the target visual style). However, the sign is more universally understood.\n    *   To show \"at a busy intersection\":\n        *   An intersection (where two or more roads meet).\n        *   Other vehicles (to indicate \"busy\").\n        *   Traffic control elements typical of a busy intersection (e.g., traffic lights).\n        *   Road markings (lane lines, crosswalks).\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase (ensuring no uncertainty to Key Requirement):**\n\n    *   The vehicle performing the U-turn is essential.\n    *   The \"No U-turn\" sign is essential to make the violation \"clearly identifiable.\"\n    *   The intersection itself is essential.\n    *   Other vehicles are essential for \"busy.\"\n    *   Traffic lights are a strong indicator of a \"busy intersection\" and help define it.\n    *   Road markings are essential for defining an intersection and traffic flow.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A vehicle performing a U-turn\n*   A \"No U-turn\" sign\n*   An intersection of roads\n*   Other vehicles (not making a U-turn)\n*   Traffic lights\n*   Road markings (e.g., lane lines, crosswalks)"
