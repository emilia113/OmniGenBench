  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must clearly depict a specific rule violation occurring within the context of the respective sport.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate an image that illustrates a blocking foul in basketball.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to clearly show a *blocking foul* happening during a *basketball* game. This means we need elements of a basketball game, and specific visual cues that define a blocking foul (as opposed to a charge or other contact).\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for \"blocking foul in basketball\":**\n\n    *   **Basketball Context:**\n        *   Basketball court (lines, wood texture)\n        *   Basketball hoop and backboard (at least one visible to orient the action)\n        *   A basketball\n        *   At least two basketball players in identifiable basketball attire.\n\n    *   **Blocking Foul Elements (Key Requirement focus):**\n        *   An offensive player (often driving, in motion, possibly with the ball or just having released it).\n        *   A defensive player.\n        *   Physical contact between the offensive and defensive player.\n        *   **Crucial for \"blocking\":** Indication that the defensive player *did not* establish a legal guarding position *before* the offensive player was in the air or initiated their upward motion (if a shot/layup) OR that the defender moved into the path of the offensive player without giving them space/time to avoid contact. This can be shown by:\n            *   The defensive player moving laterally or forward into the offensive player's path at the point of contact.\n            *   The defensive player's feet not being set or shuffling at the moment of contact.\n            *   The defensive player leaning in or extending arms/body into the offensive player's space illegally.\n        *   The offensive player being impeded or knocked off balance as a result of this contact.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n*   Basketball court markings\n*   Basketball hoop and backboard\n*   An offensive basketball player\n*   A defensive basketball player\n*   A basketball\n*   Distinct basketball uniforms on players\n*   Physical contact between the offensive and defensive player\n*   Visual cue of defensive player's illegal movement (e.g., not stationary, moving into offensive player's path, feet not set)\n*   Visual cue of offensive player being impeded by the contact (e.g., falling, off-balance, path blocked by illegal defensive movement)"
