  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Combined Understanding:**\nThe image must show a volleyball game in progress, and specifically, a player committing a blocking violation. The violation itself needs to be visually clear. Common blocking violations include touching the net while blocking, reaching over the net to block before the opponent has attacked, or a back-row player illegally blocking. A net touch is often the most straightforward to depict visually.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A volleyball net\n*   A volleyball court (with visible lines)\n*   At least one player in a blocking posture (e.g., hands up near the top of the net)\n*   The blocking player's hand or arm visibly making contact with the volleyball net (depicting a net touch violation)\n*   A volleyball (the game ball) in play near the net/blocker"
