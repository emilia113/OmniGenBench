  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specified components or structures relevant to the subject of the diagram.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled cross-sectional diagram of a flowering plant, showing roots, stem, and leaf arrangement.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine:** The prompt asks for a \"labeled cross-sectional diagram\" of a \"flowering plant\" specifically \"showing roots, stem, and leaf arrangement.\" The Key Requirement emphasizes that these \"specified components\" (roots, stem, leaf arrangement) must be \"accurately depicted and labeled.\"\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n\n    *   The overall subject is a \"flowering plant.\"\n    *   The style of the diagram is \"cross-sectional.\" This means we should see internal details or a cutaway view.\n    *   Component 1: \"roots\" must be shown.\n    *   Component 2: \"stem\" must be shown.\n    *   Component 3: \"leaf arrangement\" must be shown (this implies leaves themselves must be visible, arranged in a discernible pattern on the stem).\n    *   Labeling: Each of these specified components (roots, stem, leaf arrangement) needs a label.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Cross-sectional view of a flowering plant\n*   Visual depiction of roots\n*   Visual depiction of a stem\n*   Visual depiction of leaves\n*   Clear visual pattern of leaf arrangement on the stem\n*   Text label for \"Roots\"\n*   Text label for \"Stem\"\n*   Text label for \"Leaf Arrangement\" (or \"Leaves\" if the label clearly points to the arrangement)"
