  "Okay, here's the breakdown of visual elements for the phenylalanine molecular diagram.\n\n**Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label the specified components or structures relevant to the subject of the diagram.\n**Prompt:** Generate a molecular diagram of the amino acid phenylalanine, showing its atomic structure and side chain.\n\nCombining these, the image must show all atoms of phenylalanine, their bonds, and labels for the atoms, the molecule itself, and its side chain. Assuming the common non-ionized form (Hâ‚‚N-CHR-COOH) for a general molecular diagram:\n\n*   **Alpha-carbon atom (labeled 'C')**\n*   **Amino group nitrogen atom (labeled 'N')**\n*   **Two amino group hydrogen atoms (labeled 'H')**\n*   **Carboxyl group carbon atom (labeled 'C')**\n*   **Carboxyl group double-bonded oxygen atom (labeled 'O')**\n*   **Carboxyl group hydroxyl oxygen atom (labeled 'O')**\n*   **Carboxyl group hydroxyl hydrogen atom (labeled 'H')**\n*   **Hydrogen atom on alpha-carbon (labeled 'H')**\n*   **Side chain methylene carbon atom (labeled 'C')**\n*   **Two side chain methylene hydrogen atoms (labeled 'H')**\n*   **Six side chain phenyl ring carbon atoms (labeled 'C')**\n*   **Five side chain phenyl ring hydrogen atoms (labeled 'H')**\n*   **Visual representation of single bonds** (lines connecting atoms)\n*   **Visual representation of double bonds** (e.g., in carboxyl group and phenyl ring)\n*   **Text label \"Phenylalanine\"** (identifying the entire molecule)\n*   **Text label indicating the \"side chain\"** (pointing to or encompassing the benzyl group)"
