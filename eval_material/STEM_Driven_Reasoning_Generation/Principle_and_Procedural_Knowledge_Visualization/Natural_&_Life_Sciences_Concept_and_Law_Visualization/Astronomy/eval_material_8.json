["Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must include clearly labeled components that accurately represent the specified astronomical or celestial concept.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled close-up diagram of Saturn's ring system, showing the A, B, and C rings along with the Cassini Division.\n\n**Procedure:**\n1.  **Combine:** The prompt specifies \"Saturn's ring system,\" \"A, B, and C rings,\" and \"Cassini Division.\" The Key Requirement mandates these (and any other necessary components for accuracy) must be \"clearly labeled.\" The \"close-up diagram\" nature implies a focus on these elements.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n    *   The A ring itself needs to be visible.\n    *   The B ring itself needs to be visible.\n    *   The C ring itself needs to be visible.\n    *   The Cassini Division (the gap, primarily between A and B rings) needs to be visible.\n    *   A label pointing to or identifying the A ring.\n    *   A label pointing to or identifying the B ring.\n    *   A label pointing to or identifying the C ring.\n    *   A label pointing to or identifying the Cassini Division.\n    *   To show a \"ring system,\" at least a portion of Saturn itself would typically be visible to provide context for what the rings are encircling.\n\n3.  **Write as short noun phrases:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Visual representation of A ring\n*   Visual representation of B ring\n*   Visual representation of C ring\n*   Visual representation of Cassini Division\n*   Label for A ring\n*   Label for B ring\n*   Label for C ring\n*   Label for Cassini Division\n*   Portion of Saturn (as context for the ring system)"]
