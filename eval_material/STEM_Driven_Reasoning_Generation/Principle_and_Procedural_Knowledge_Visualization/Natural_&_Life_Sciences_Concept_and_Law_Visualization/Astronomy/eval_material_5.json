  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label specific astronomical or astrophysical phenomena as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a conceptual diagram showing the formation of a planetary nebula.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be a *conceptual diagram*. This means it likely won't be photorealistic but will use simplified representations to explain a process. The process is the *formation of a planetary nebula*. The Key Requirement mandates that the astronomical phenomena involved in this formation must be *accurately depicted* and *labeled*.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for \"formation of a planetary nebula\":**\n    The formation process involves several key stages/components:\n    *   An aging star (typically a red giant) that is the progenitor.\n    *   The ejection of its outer layers of gas and dust.\n    *   The remaining hot core of the star (which will become a white dwarf).\n    *   This hot core emits ultraviolet radiation.\n    *   The UV radiation ionizes the ejected gas, causing it to glow â€“ this is the planetary nebula.\n    *   Since it's a \"conceptual diagram,\" labels for these components are essential as per the Key Requirement.\n    *   Arrows or sequencing might be used to show the \"formation\" process.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Red giant star (initial stage)\n*   Label for \"Red Giant Star\" (or similar)\n*   Expanding shell of gas and dust (ejected outer layers)\n*   Label for \"Ejected Outer Layers\" (or similar)\n*   Hot, compact central star (exposed core/pre-white dwarf)\n*   Label for \"Central Star\" or \"Hot Core\" (or similar)\n*   Glowing, ionized gas forming the planetary nebula structure\n*   Label for \"Planetary Nebula\" (or similar)\n*   Visual cue for ultraviolet radiation from central star (e.g., rays, glow effect on gas)\n*   Label for \"Ultraviolet Radiation\" (or similar, if radiation is explicitly visualized)\n*   Arrows or visual indicators of progression/sequence of formation stages"
