  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label specific astronomical or astrophysical phenomena as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a conceptual diagram of a star's life cycle focusing on the red giant phase, showing its size, fusion processes, and outward expansion.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining the Key Requirement with the prompt, we need to identify concrete visual elements that are explicitly or implicitly demanded, especially those needing labels or accurate depiction related to the red giant phase.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A stellar object representing a red giant.\n*   Label for \"Red Giant Phase\" (or \"Red Giant\").\n*   Visual representation of the red giant's large size (e.g., relative to a previous stage, if shown, or implied by its structure).\n*   Depiction of internal structure within the red giant showing fusion regions.\n*   Indication of a core fusion region within the red giant.\n*   Label for \"Helium fusion\" (or \"Helium burning\") in the core.\n*   Indication of a shell fusion region surrounding the core.\n*   Label for \"Hydrogen shell fusion\" (or \"Hydrogen shell burning\") in the shell.\n*   Visual representation of outward expansion (e.g., arrows, expanding outer layers).\n*   Label for \"Outward Expansion.\"\n*   (Optional but strongly implied for context of \"size\" and \"life cycle focus\"): A smaller stellar object representing a pre-red giant star (e.g., main-sequence star).\n*   (If the pre-red giant star is shown): Arrow indicating progression to the red giant phase."
