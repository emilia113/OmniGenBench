"Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must include clearly labeled components that accurately represent the specified astronomical or celestial concept.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled orbital diagram illustrating a close binary star system with two stars orbiting a common center of mass.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be an orbital diagram. It must show a close binary star system. This means two stars. These stars orbit a common center of mass (barycenter). All key components (stars, barycenter, orbits) must be clearly labeled. The representation must be accurate for a binary system.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Stars:**\n        *   First star (visual representation, e.g., a sphere/circle)\n        *   Second star (visual representation, distinct from the first if possible, e.g., different size/color, but at least a separate object)\n    *   **Orbits:**\n        *   Orbital path for the first star (e.g., an elliptical or circular line)\n        *   Orbital path for the second star (e.g., an elliptical or circular line, typically smaller if the star is less massive or vice-versa, and on the opposite side of the barycenter)\n    *   **Center of Mass:**\n        *   Common center of mass point (barycenter, often marked with an 'x' or a dot)\n    *   **Labels (as per Key Requirement and \"labeled orbital diagram\"):**\n        *   Label for the first star\n        *   Label for the second star\n        *   Label for the common center of mass (barycenter)\n        *   Label for the first star's orbit (optional but good for clarity, let's assume \"clearly labeled components\" implies this for a diagram)\n        *   Label for the second star's orbit (similarly, good for clarity)\n    *   **Directional Indicators (implied by \"orbital diagram\" for clarity):**\n        *   Directional arrow on the first star's orbit\n        *   Directional arrow on the second star's orbit\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   First star depiction\n*   Second star depiction\n*   Orbital path for first star\n*   Orbital path for second star\n*   Common center of mass marker\n*   Label for first star\n*   Label for second star\n*   Label for common center of mass\n*   Label for first star's orbit\n*   Label for second star's orbit\n*   Directional arrow on first star's orbit\n*   Directional arrow on second star's orbit"
