  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label specific astronomical or astrophysical phenomena as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled reaction diagram of the proton-proton chain in the Sun’s core.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine:** The Key Requirement emphasizes accurate depiction and labeling. The prompt specifies the \"proton-proton chain\" as the phenomenon, requiring a \"labeled reaction diagram.\"\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for the proton-proton chain (PP-I branch, the most common):**\n\n    *   **Reactants & Products (Particles):**\n        *   Protons (Hydrogen nuclei, ¹H or p⁺)\n        *   Deuterium (²H or D)\n        *   Positrons (e⁺)\n        *   Electron Neutrinos (νe)\n        *   Helium-3 (³He)\n        *   Gamma rays (γ)\n        *   Helium-4 (⁴He or α particle)\n\n    *   **Diagrammatic Elements:**\n        *   Arrows showing reaction flow/transformations.\n        *   Labels for each particle type.\n        *   Grouping or staging to show the steps of the chain.\n        *   A title for the diagram.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Visual representations of protons (e.g., ¹H or p⁺).\n*   Labels for protons.\n*   Visual representations of deuterium (e.g., ²H).\n*   Labels for deuterium.\n*   Visual representations of positrons (e.g., e⁺).\n*   Labels for positrons.\n*   Visual representations of electron neutrinos (e.g., νe).\n*   Labels for electron neutrinos.\n*   Visual representations of Helium-3 nuclei (e.g., ³He).\n*   Labels for Helium-3 nuclei.\n*   Visual representations of gamma rays (e.g., γ).\n*   Labels for gamma rays.\n*   Visual representations of Helium-4 nuclei (e.g., ⁴He).\n*   Labels for Helium-4 nuclei.\n*   Arrows indicating reaction pathways.\n*   A title or overall label for the diagram (e.g., \"Proton-Proton Chain\").\n*   Clear depiction of the three main reaction steps of the PP-I chain."
