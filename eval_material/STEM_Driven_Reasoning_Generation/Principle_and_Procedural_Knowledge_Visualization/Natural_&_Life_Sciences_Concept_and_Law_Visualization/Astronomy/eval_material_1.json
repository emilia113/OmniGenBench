  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label specific astronomical or astrophysical phenomena as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled conceptual diagram showing the expansion of the universe from the Big Bang to the present, with scale and time markers.\n\n**Procedure:**\nCombining these, the image needs to be a \"labeled conceptual diagram\" that \"accurately depicts\" the \"expansion of the universe,\" the \"Big Bang,\" the \"present,\" and includes \"scale markers\" and \"time markers\" with appropriate labels.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required visual elements:\n\n*   Visual representation of universe expansion (e.g., a widening shape like a cone or funnel)\n*   Visual marker for the Big Bang event (e.g., the origin point of the expansion)\n*   Text label: \"Big Bang\" (or similar, associated with the origin point)\n*   Visual marker for the present time (e.g., the end boundary of the expansion diagram)\n*   Text label: \"Present\" (or \"Present Day,\" associated with the end boundary)\n*   Multiple distinct time markers along the expansion timeline\n*   Text labels for time markers (e.g., \"1 second,\" \"380,000 years,\" \"1 billion years,\" \"13.8 billion years\")\n*   Multiple distinct scale markers indicating universe size/scale at different times\n*   Text labels for scale markers (e.g., relative size indicators or specific distance units if appropriate for a conceptual diagram)"
