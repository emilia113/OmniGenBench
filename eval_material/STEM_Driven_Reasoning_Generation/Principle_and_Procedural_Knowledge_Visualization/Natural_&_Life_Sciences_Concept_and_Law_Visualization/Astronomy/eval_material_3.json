  "Okay, let's proceed with Part 2.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict and label specific astronomical or astrophysical phenomena as described in the prompt.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a space illustration of a black hole with a brightly glowing accretion disk and surrounding matter spiraling inward.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    *   The prompt describes several astronomical phenomena: a \"black hole,\" a \"brightly glowing accretion disk,\" and \"surrounding matter spiraling inward.\"\n    *   The Key Requirement states these phenomena must be \"accurately depicted.\"\n    *   The Key Requirement *also* mentions \"label\" specific phenomena. However, the prompt *itself* does not explicitly ask for labels (e.g., \"label the event horizon\"). Therefore, for *this specific prompt*, visual labels are not a *must-have* element derived directly from the prompt's wording, even though the Key Requirement allows for it if the prompt specified. We will focus on the visual depiction.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n    *   **Black Hole:** This is the central phenomenon. Visually, it's often represented as a region of pure blackness or a distorted view of spacetime around it.\n    *   **Accretion Disk:** This is described as \"brightly glowing\" and is associated with the black hole. It's a disk-like structure.\n    *   **Surrounding Matter Spiraling Inward:** This describes material distinct from, or feeding into, the accretion disk, showing a clear pattern of inward motion.\n    *   **Space Background:** The context \"space illustration\" implies a backdrop typical of space (e.g., darkness, perhaps distant stars or nebulae, though not explicitly detailed beyond \"space\").\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Central black hole\n*   Brightly glowing accretion disk (around the black hole)\n*   Surrounding matter spiraling inward (towards the accretion disk/black hole)\n*   Space background"
