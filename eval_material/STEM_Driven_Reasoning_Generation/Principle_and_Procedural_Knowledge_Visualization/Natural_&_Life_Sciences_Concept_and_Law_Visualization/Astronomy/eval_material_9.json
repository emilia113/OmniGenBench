["Okay, here's the breakdown for the prompt: \"Generate a simplified conceptual diagram showing the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.\"\n\n**Combined Understanding:**\nThe image needs to be a simplified diagram. It must show the Kuiper Belt. It must show Neptune. The Kuiper Belt must be positioned *beyond* Neptune (relative to a central point, implicitly the Sun). All key components (Neptune, Kuiper Belt, and likely the Sun for context) must be clearly labeled.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   The Sun (or central star representation)\n*   Label for the Sun\n*   Planet Neptune\n*   Label for Neptune\n*   Neptune's orbital path (or indication of its orbit)\n*   Kuiper Belt region (distinct from Neptune's orbit and located further out)\n*   Label for the Kuiper Belt\n*   Multiple small objects within the Kuiper Belt region (to represent KBOs)"]
