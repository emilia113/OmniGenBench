  "Okay, here's the breakdown for the 2D Lewis structure of a water molecule (H₂O).\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific diagram with correct and clearly identifiable components or structures.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a 2D Lewis structure diagram of a water molecule (H₂O).\n\n**Procedure & Identification:**\n\n1.  **Molecule:** H₂O\n    *   Central atom: Oxygen (O)\n    *   Peripheral atoms: Two Hydrogen (H) atoms\n2.  **Lewis Structure Rules for H₂O:**\n    *   Oxygen has 6 valence electrons. It will form 2 bonds and have 2 lone pairs (4 electrons) to achieve an octet.\n    *   Each Hydrogen has 1 valence electron. It will form 1 bond to achieve a duet.\n    *   Connectivity: Each Hydrogen is bonded to the central Oxygen.\n3.  **Visual Representation:**\n    *   Atomic symbols: \"O\" for Oxygen, \"H\" for Hydrogen.\n    *   Bonds: Single lines between connected atoms.\n    *   Lone pairs: Dots, typically grouped in pairs, around the atom they belong to (Oxygen in this case).\n    *   Arrangement: While Lewis structures primarily show connectivity and valence electrons, for H₂O, a bent structure is the standard and most \"accurate\" 2D representation, reflecting VSEPR theory even if not explicitly requested by \"Lewis structure\" alone. A linear H-O-H would be less conventional for a depiction of water.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   One Oxygen atom symbol (\"O\")\n*   Two Hydrogen atom symbols (\"H\")\n*   A single line representing a covalent bond connecting the Oxygen symbol to one Hydrogen symbol\n*   A single line representing a covalent bond connecting the Oxygen symbol to the other Hydrogen symbol\n*   Two pairs of dots representing lone pair electrons, located on the Oxygen symbol\n*   The Oxygen symbol positioned centrally relative to the two Hydrogen symbols\n*   A generally bent arrangement of the H-O-H structure (i.e., not linear)"
