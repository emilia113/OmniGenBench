  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific diagram with correct and clearly identifiable components or structures.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a ball-and-stick molecular diagram of ethanol (C₂H₅OH), showing all atoms and bonds in 3D perspective.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image needs to be a ball-and-stick model of ethanol. This means:\n    *   Atoms are represented as spheres (\"balls\").\n    *   Bonds are represented as cylinders/rods (\"sticks\").\n    *   The molecule is ethanol (C₂H₅OH), so we need:\n        *   2 Carbon atoms\n        *   6 Hydrogen atoms (5 on carbons, 1 on oxygen)\n        *   1 Oxygen atom\n    *   All bonds must be shown:\n        *   1 C-C bond\n        *   5 C-H bonds (on the carbons)\n        *   1 C-O bond\n        *   1 O-H bond\n    *   The representation must be in 3D perspective.\n    *   All these components (atoms, bonds) must be correct and clearly identifiable. This implies distinct representations for different atom types (typically color in ball-and-stick models) and clear separation/connection of atoms and bonds.\n\n2.  **Identify Distinct Visual Elements:**\n\n    *   **Atoms (Balls):**\n        *   Two carbon atom spheres (typically black or grey).\n        *   Six hydrogen atom spheres (typically white).\n        *   One oxygen atom sphere (typically red).\n    *   **Bonds (Sticks):**\n        *   One carbon-carbon single bond stick.\n        *   Five carbon-hydrogen single bond sticks.\n        *   One carbon-oxygen single bond stick.\n        *   One oxygen-hydrogen single bond stick.\n    *   **Structure & Perspective:**\n        *   Correct connectivity of atoms for ethanol (CH₃-CH₂-OH).\n        *   Approximate tetrahedral geometry around each carbon atom.\n        *   Approximate bent geometry around the oxygen atom.\n        *   Overall 3D perspective view of the molecule.\n    *   **Clarity (from Key Requirement):**\n        *   Clear visual distinction between atom types (e.g., by color).\n        *   Clear visual distinction between atom spheres and bond sticks.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Two distinct carbon atom spheres.\n*   Six distinct hydrogen atom spheres.\n*   One distinct oxygen atom sphere.\n*   One carbon-carbon bond stick.\n*   Five carbon-hydrogen bond sticks.\n*   One carbon-oxygen bond stick.\n*   One oxygen-hydrogen bond stick.\n*   Correct molecular connectivity for ethanol.\n*   Representation of 3D perspective.\n*   Clear visual differentiation of atom types.\n*   Clear visual differentiation between atom spheres and bond sticks."
