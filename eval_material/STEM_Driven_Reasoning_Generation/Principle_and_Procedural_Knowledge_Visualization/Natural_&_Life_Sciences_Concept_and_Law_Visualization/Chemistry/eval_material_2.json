  "Okay, let's break this down for an electron orbital diagram of Iron (Fe).\nIron (Fe) has an atomic number of 26, so it has 26 electrons.\nThe electron configuration is: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d⁶.\n\nKey Requirement: The image must accurately depict the specified scientific diagram with correct and clearly identifiable components or structures.\nPrompt: Generate an electron orbital diagram for an iron atom (Fe).\n\nCombining these, the visual elements must represent the orbitals and the electron filling according to Hund's Rule and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n\n*   Representation of the 1s orbital (e.g., a single box or line)\n*   Label \"1s\" clearly associated with the 1s orbital\n*   Two electrons (paired, opposite spins, e.g., one up arrow, one down arrow) in the 1s orbital\n*   Representation of the 2s orbital\n*   Label \"2s\" clearly associated with the 2s orbital\n*   Two electrons (paired, opposite spins) in the 2s orbital\n*   Representation of the three 2p orbitals (degenerate, e.g., three connected boxes or lines at the same energy level)\n*   Label \"2p\" clearly associated with the 2p orbitals\n*   Six electrons (all paired, opposite spins) filling the 2p orbitals\n*   Representation of the 3s orbital\n*   Label \"3s\" clearly associated with the 3s orbital\n*   Two electrons (paired, opposite spins) in the 3s orbital\n*   Representation of the three 3p orbitals (degenerate)\n*   Label \"3p\" clearly associated with the 3p orbitals\n*   Six electrons (all paired, opposite spins) filling the 3p orbitals\n*   Representation of the 4s orbital\n*   Label \"4s\" clearly associated with the 4s orbital\n*   Two electrons (paired, opposite spins) in the 4s orbital\n*   Representation of the five 3d orbitals (degenerate)\n*   Label \"3d\" clearly associated with the 3d orbitals\n*   Six electrons in the 3d orbitals, distributed according to Hund's rule (i.e., one electron in each of the first five 3d orbitals with parallel spins, then a sixth electron pairing up in one of these, resulting in one paired set and four unpaired electrons with parallel spins)\n*   Clear visual distinction for electron spin (e.g., upward arrows for spin-up, downward arrows for spin-down)\n*   Visual arrangement of orbitals generally indicating increasing energy levels (1s lowest, then 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, then 3d)"
