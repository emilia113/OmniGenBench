  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific diagram with correct and clearly identifiable components or structures.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a labeled diagram of simple distillation apparatus, including flask, condenser, thermometer, and receiving flask.\n\n**Procedure & Identification:**\n\n1.  **Overall Subject:** The prompt asks for a \"simple distillation apparatus.\" This is the overarching structure.\n2.  **Explicitly Named Components (must be present and identifiable as per Key Requirement):**\n    *   \"flask\": In this context, it's the distillation flask (or heating flask).\n    *   \"condenser\": A standard Liebig condenser is typical for simple distillation.\n    *   \"thermometer\": Must be placed correctly to measure vapor temperature.\n    *   \"receiving flask\": To collect the distillate.\n3.  **\"Labeled diagram\" Requirement:** This means text labels must be associated with the specified components.\n4.  **Implicit Components for an \"accurate\" simple distillation apparatus (as per Key Requirement):**\n    *   **Heat source:** Distillation requires heating the initial flask.\n    *   **Support structure:** Glassware needs to be held by stands and clamps.\n    *   **Connections/Adapters:**\n        *   A still head (or distillation head) is typically used to connect the distillation flask, thermometer, and condenser.\n        *   The condenser needs water inlet and outlet tubes.\n        *   An adapter might be needed between the condenser and the receiving flask.\n    *   **Contents (implied but not strictly a visual *element* of the apparatus itself, more a state):**\n        *   Liquid in the distillation flask (the mixture to be distilled).\n        *   Liquid (distillate) in the receiving flask.\n        *   Water flowing through the condenser (often indicated by arrows).\n\n**Refining to \"distinct visual elements\" as short noun phrases:**\n\n*   Distillation flask (the \"flask\" mentioned)\n*   Condenser\n*   Thermometer (correctly positioned)\n*   Receiving flask\n*   Heat source (e.g., Bunsen burner, heating mantle)\n*   Support stand(s)\n*   Clamp(s) (holding the glassware)\n*   Still head (or distillation head)\n*   Condenser water inlet tube\n*   Condenser water outlet tube\n*   Delivery adapter (connecting condenser to receiving flask)\n*   Label for \"Distillation flask\"\n*   Label for \"Condenser\"\n*   Label for \"Thermometer\"\n*   Label for \"Receiving flask\"\n\nOutput from Part 2:\n\n*   Distillation flask\n*   Condenser\n*   Thermometer\n*   Receiving flask\n*   Heat source\n*   Support stand\n*   Clamps\n*   Still head\n*   Condenser water inlet tube\n*   Condenser water outlet tube\n*   Delivery adapter\n*   Label for \"Distillation flask\"\n*   Label for \"Condenser\"\n*   Label for \"Thermometer\"\n*   Label for \"Receiving flask\""
