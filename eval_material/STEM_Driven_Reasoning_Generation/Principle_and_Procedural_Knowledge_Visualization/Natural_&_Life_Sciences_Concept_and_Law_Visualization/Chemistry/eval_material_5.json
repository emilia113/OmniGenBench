  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the specified scientific diagram with correct and clearly identifiable components or structures.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate a Bohr model diagram of a sodium atom.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image must be an accurate Bohr model of a sodium atom, with all its components (nucleus, protons, neutrons, electron shells, electrons) correctly represented and clearly identifiable.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for a Bohr model of Sodium (Na):**\n    *   Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11, meaning 11 protons and, in a neutral atom, 11 electrons.\n    *   The most common isotope is Sodium-23, meaning 23 (mass number) - 11 (protons) = 12 neutrons.\n    *   Electron configuration for Sodium: 2 electrons in the first shell, 8 electrons in the second shell, 1 electron in the third shell.\n\n    Therefore, the visual elements are:\n\n    *   A central nucleus.\n    *   An indication of 11 protons within or associated with the nucleus (e.g., a label like \"11p+\" or 11 distinct proton representations if detailed).\n    *   An indication of 12 neutrons within or associated with the nucleus (e.g., a label like \"12n\" or 12 distinct neutron representations if detailed).\n    *   A first electron shell (innermost, concentric to the nucleus).\n    *   Two electrons depicted on the first electron shell.\n    *   A second electron shell (concentric to the nucleus, outside the first).\n    *   Eight electrons depicted on the second electron shell.\n    *   A third electron shell (outermost, concentric to the nucleus, outside the second).\n    *   One electron depicted on the third electron shell.\n    *   (Optional but highly recommended for clarity, and implied by \"clearly identifiable components\"): A label identifying the atom as \"Sodium\" or \"Na\".\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Central nucleus\n*   Indication of 11 protons (e.g., \"11p+\" label or count within the nucleus)\n*   Indication of 12 neutrons (e.g., \"12n\" label or count within the nucleus)\n*   First electron shell (innermost ring)\n*   Two electron representations on the first electron shell\n*   Second electron shell (middle ring)\n*   Eight electron representations on the second electron shell\n*   Third electron shell (outermost ring)\n*   One electron representation on the third electron shell"
