  "Okay, here's the breakdown for the `y = tanh(x)` prompt.\n\nInput to Part 2:\n- Key Requirement: The image must accurately depict the graph of the specified mathematical function.\n- Specific Prompt: Generate the graph of the function y = \\tanh{x}\n\nProcedure:\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:** The image must accurately depict the graph of `y = tanh(x)`.\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements:**\n    *   To \"accurately depict a graph,\" we need axes.\n    *   These axes need labels.\n    *   The axes need scales (tick marks and numbers).\n    *   The function `y = tanh(x)` has specific characteristics:\n        *   It's an S-shaped curve.\n        *   It passes through the origin (0,0).\n        *   It has horizontal asymptotes at y = 1 and y = -1.\n        *   The y-axis scale must therefore clearly show -1 and 1.\n        *   The x-axis scale should show a range where the S-shape and approach to asymptotes are visible (e.g., -3 to 3 or -5 to 5).\n\nOutput from Part 2:\nA bullet list of required elements:\n*   A horizontal x-axis.\n*   A vertical y-axis.\n*   An \"x\" label for the x-axis.\n*   A \"y\" label for the y-axis.\n*   Tick marks on the x-axis.\n*   Tick marks on the y-axis.\n*   Numerical labels for x-axis tick marks.\n*   Numerical labels for y-axis tick marks, including at least \"-1\", \"0\", and \"1\".\n*   The plotted curve of y = tanh(x).\n*   The curve passing through the origin (0,0).\n*   The curve approaching the horizontal line y=1 as x increases.\n*   The curve approaching the horizontal line y=-1 as x decreases."
