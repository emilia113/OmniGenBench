  "Based on the Key Requirement and the specific prompt:\n\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the graph of the specified mathematical function.\n*   **Prompt:** Generate the graph of the function y = \\ln\\left(x^2 + 1\\right)\n\nThe distinct visual elements required are:\n\n*   A plotted curve accurately representing the function y = \\ln\\left(x^2 + 1\\right). (This implies the curve must pass through the origin (0,0), have its minimum value at the origin, be symmetric about the y-axis, and increase as |x| increases from 0, and be entirely above or touching the x-axis).\n*   A horizontal x-axis.\n*   A vertical y-axis."
