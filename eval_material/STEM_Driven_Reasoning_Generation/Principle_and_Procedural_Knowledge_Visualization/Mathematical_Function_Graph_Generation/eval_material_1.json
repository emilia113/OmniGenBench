  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the graph of the specified mathematical function.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate the graph of the function y = x\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Specific Prompt:**\n    The image must accurately depict the graph of y = x.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for an accurate graph of y = x:**\n    *   To have a graph, we need axes.\n    *   These axes need to be labeled to know which is which.\n    *   The axes need scales (tick marks and numbers) to understand the units and values.\n    *   The function y = x itself needs to be plotted. This is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1.\n    *   The origin (0,0) is a key point.\n    *   Grid lines are common and aid in accuracy.\n    *   A title or label indicating what function is graphed is also standard for clarity.\n\n3.  **Write each element as a short noun phrase:**\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   A horizontal x-axis\n*   A vertical y-axis\n*   An 'x' label for the x-axis\n*   A 'y' label for the y-axis\n*   Tick marks on the x-axis\n*   Tick marks on the y-axis\n*   Numerical scale markings on the x-axis\n*   Numerical scale markings on the y-axis\n*   A clearly defined origin (0,0)\n*   A straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1 (representing y=x)\n*   (Optional but highly recommended for clarity/accuracy) Grid lines corresponding to axis tick marks\n*   (Optional but common) A title or label indicating the function (e.g., \"y = x\")"
