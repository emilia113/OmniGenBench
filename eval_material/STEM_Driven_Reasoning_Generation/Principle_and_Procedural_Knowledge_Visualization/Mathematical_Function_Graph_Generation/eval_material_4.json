  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Input to Part 2:**\n*   **Key Requirement:** The image must accurately depict the graph of the specified mathematical function.\n*   **Specific Prompt:** Generate the graph of the function y = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Combine Key Requirement and Prompt:**\n    The image must accurately depict the graph of y = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.\n    This function is the sigmoid function. Key characteristics:\n    *   It's an S-shaped curve.\n    *   It passes through (0, 0.5).\n    *   It has horizontal asymptotes at y=0 (as x → -∞) and y=1 (as x → +∞).\n    *   It is continuous and smooth.\n\n2.  **Identify distinct visual elements for an \"accurate depiction\" of this graph:**\n\n    *   **The curve itself:** This is paramount. It must have the correct shape (S-shape), pass through key points like (0, 0.5), and show the asymptotic behavior.\n    *   **Axes:** A graph needs a coordinate system.\n        *   A horizontal axis (x-axis).\n        *   A vertical axis (y-axis).\n    *   **Axis Labels:** To identify what the axes represent.\n        *   Label for the x-axis (typically \"x\").\n        *   Label for the y-axis (typically \"y\").\n    *   **Scale/Tick Marks:** To understand the values represented.\n        *   Tick marks on the x-axis.\n        *   Numerical labels for these x-axis tick marks (e.g., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4).\n        *   Tick marks on the y-axis.\n        *   Numerical labels for these y-axis tick marks (e.g., 0, 0.5, 1.0). The range [0, 1] is critical for the y-axis.\n    *   **Origin:** The point (0,0) where the axes intersect, if visible within the chosen plot range.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   Plotted curve of the function y = 1/(1+e^-x)\n*   Horizontal x-axis\n*   Vertical y-axis\n*   X-axis label\n*   Y-axis label\n*   X-axis tick marks\n*   Y-axis tick marks\n*   Numerical scale labels on the x-axis\n*   Numerical scale labels on the y-axis (clearly showing the 0 to 1 range)"
