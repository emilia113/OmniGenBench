  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Combined Understanding:**\nThe image needs to show the step-by-step differentiation of f(x) = x² * ln(x) using the product rule. Each step, including the rule itself, identification of parts, individual derivatives, substitution, and simplification, must be presented clearly, line by line, with all relevant mathematical notation.\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\n*   The text \"Problem:\" (or similar heading).\n*   The function to be differentiated: \"f(x) = x² • ln(x)\" (or similar notation).\n*   A statement or indication of using the Product Rule (e.g., \"Using the Product Rule: d/dx [u(x)v(x)] = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\" or \"(uv)' = u'v + uv'\").\n*   Identification of \"u = x²\".\n*   Identification of \"v = ln(x)\".\n*   Calculation of \"du/dx (or u') = 2x\".\n*   Calculation of \"dv/dx (or v') = 1/x\".\n*   The application of the product rule showing substitution: \"f'(x) = (2x)(ln x) + (x²)(1/x)\".\n*   The simplified step: \"f'(x) = 2x ln x + x\".\n*   The final factored answer (common practice): \"f'(x) = x(2 ln x + 1)\".\n*   Mathematical symbols for derivative (e.g., f'(x), d/dx).\n*   Mathematical symbols for multiplication (e.g., •, or juxtaposition as in 2x).\n*   Mathematical symbol for natural logarithm (ln).\n*   Mathematical symbol for exponentiation (e.g., x²).\n*   Equals signs (=) connecting expressions in each step.\n*   Plus signs (+) where appropriate in expressions.\n*   Parentheses ( ) for grouping terms and showing multiplication.\n*   Each distinct mathematical statement or step presented on its own line or in a clearly separated visual block."
