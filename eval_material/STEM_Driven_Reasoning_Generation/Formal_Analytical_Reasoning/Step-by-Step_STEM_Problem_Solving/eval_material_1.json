  "Okay, here's the list of concrete visual elements for the physics problem solution:\n\n*   The problem statement text: \"A 2 kg object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Ignoring air resistance, calculate the velocity just before it hits the ground.\"\n*   A \"Given\" (or \"Knowns\") section label/heading.\n*   Text line: \"mass (m) = 2 kg\" (or similar notation).\n*   Text line: \"height (h) = 10 m\" (or similar notation).\n*   Text line: \"initial velocity (v₀ or vᵢ) = 0 m/s\" (explicitly stating it's zero because \"dropped\").\n*   Text line: \"acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s²\" (or 9.81 m/s², a standard value).\n*   A \"Find\" (or \"To Find\" / \"Unknown\") section label/heading.\n*   Text line: \"final velocity (v or v_f)\" (or similar notation).\n*   An \"Equation\" (or \"Formula\") section label/heading.\n*   The relevant physics equation, e.g., \"v² = v₀² + 2gh\" or \"mgh = ½mv²\" (if using energy conservation).\n*   A \"Solution\" (or \"Calculation\") section label/heading.\n*   Calculation line 1: The chosen equation with numerical values substituted (e.g., \"v² = (0 m/s)² + 2 * (9.8 m/s²) * (10 m)\").\n*   Calculation line 2: The result of the multiplication part (e.g., \"v² = 0 + 196 m²/s²\" or directly \"v² = 196 m²/s²\").\n*   Calculation line 3: The step showing the square root operation (e.g., \"v = √(196 m²/s²)\").\n*   Calculation line 4: The final numerical result for velocity with units (e.g., \"v = 14 m/s\").\n*   A \"Final Answer\" label or clear visual emphasis on the final answer.\n*   The final answer text: \"14 m/s\" (clearly presented with units)."
