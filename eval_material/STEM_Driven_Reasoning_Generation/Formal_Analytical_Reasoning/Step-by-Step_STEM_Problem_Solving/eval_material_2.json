  "Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Key Requirement:** The image must visually present a step-by-step solution for each problem, including relevant equations and calculations, presented line by line.\n\n**Specific Prompt:**\nProblem: Solve for x:\n3(x-2)+4=2x+6\n\n**Mental Walkthrough of the Solution Steps (to identify elements):**\n\n1.  **Original Equation:** 3(x-2)+4=2x+6\n2.  **Distribute 3:** 3x - 6 + 4 = 2x + 6\n3.  **Combine like terms on left (-6+4):** 3x - 2 = 2x + 6\n4.  **Subtract 2x from both sides (to gather x terms):** 3x - 2x - 2 = 2x - 2x + 6\n5.  **Simplify both sides:** x - 2 = 6\n6.  **Add 2 to both sides (to isolate x):** x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2\n7.  **Simplify/Final Solution:** x = 8\n\n**Output from Part 2:**\n\nHere is a bullet list of required visual elements:\n\n*   The text \"Problem: Solve for x:\"\n*   The initial equation \"3(x-2)+4=2x+6\" presented on its own line.\n*   The equation \"3x - 6 + 4 = 2x + 6\" presented on a subsequent line (result of distribution).\n*   The equation \"3x - 2 = 2x + 6\" presented on a subsequent line (result of combining like terms).\n*   The equation \"3x - 2 - 2x = 2x + 6 - 2x\" or \"3x - 2x - 2 = 6\" presented on a subsequent line (showing subtraction of 2x from both sides or its immediate result).\n*   The equation \"x - 2 = 6\" presented on a subsequent line (result of simplifying x terms).\n*   The equation \"x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2\" or \"x = 6 + 2\" presented on a subsequent line (showing addition of 2 to both sides or its immediate result).\n*   The final solution \"x = 8\" presented on the last line."
