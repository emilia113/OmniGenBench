  "Here is a list of every concrete visual element that the final image must contain:\n\n*   A first node (visual mark, e.g., a circle).\n*   A second node (visual mark, distinct from the first if visual styles vary, e.g., different position).\n*   A third node (visual mark, distinct from the first two if visual styles vary).\n*   A new textual label for the first node (e.g., \"X\"; must not be \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\").\n*   A new textual label for the second node (e.g., \"Y\"; must not be \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", and must be different from the first new label).\n*   A new textual label for the third node (e.g., \"Z\"; must not be \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", and must be different from the other two new labels).\n*   An edge (e.g., a line) connecting the first node and the second node.\n*   The numerical weight \"3\" visually associated with the edge between the first and second nodes.\n*   An edge (e.g., a line) connecting the second node and the third node.\n*   The numerical weight \"5\" visually associated with the edge between the second and third nodes.\n*   A spatial arrangement of the three nodes that is different from the original image's horizontal linear layout."
