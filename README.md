## 💡 Introduction

</div>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/class.png" width="92%">
</div>
With <b>50+ diverse sub-tasks</b>, OmniGenBench serves as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the generality, adaptability, and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art generative models across both perception- and cognition-oriented generation tasks.
<br><br>
OmniGenBench ensures task diversity and difficulty by building on MegaBench, a widely acknowledged multimodal benchmark. We reverse-engineer text queries from its tasks and apply human filtering for accuracy and challenge.
<br><br>
To enable precise evaluation, we design dedicated evaluation protocols for both perception- and cognition-centric tasks. Each task is assigned a tailored evaluation criterion, and our protocol aligns closely with human judgment, ensuring both accuracy and consistency in performance assessment.

## 🚀 Submit Your Model

We’re currently running evaluations on OmniGenBench — a comprehensive benchmark covering 50+ real-world tasks designed to test the limits of general-purpose image generation models.

If you’d like to see how your model performs across a variety of challenging and diverse prompts, feel free to leave a comment in the Issues section — GitHub repo, API endpoint, Hugging Face Space, or any other inference link are all welcome!
